# MEI Guidelines

This repository hosts the MEI Guidelines, the official documentation of the
[Music Encoding Initiative](http://www.music-encoding.org). Edits and contributions
are encouraged.

## WARNING – UPCOMING CHANGES

This repo is going to be merged back into the [main MEI repo](https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding) soon. That way, we can better ensure consistency between the MEI Guidelines (currently expressed in this repo), and the MEI Specification (expressed independently in the main repo). This means, however, that contributions to this repo are only possible before the transition, with some ample time to resolve remaining open issues. The ***transition*** is scheduled for ***November 9-14***, but the ***deadline for*** any new ***pull requests*** against this repo is already on ***October 26***. If you are currently preparing a pull request against this repo, please submit it no later than that date, or delay your contributions until after the transition, and into the new setup. Here is the schedule for the transition: 

* Friday, 2020-10-16, 12pm UTC: *ODD Friday*: We will discuss (and hopefully) resolve open issues and PRs we already have. 
* Monday, 2020-10-26: *Deadline for new PRs / issues*: Changes proposed after this date will not be considered for this repo anymore.
* Thursday, 2020-10-29, 12pm UTC: *ODD Thursday*: All remaining issues will be addressed before the transition.
* 2020-11-12 – 2020-11-14: *Transition of the Guidelines into the main repository*. We have scheduled a developer workshop for this week, which will be held (primarily) online. During this workshop, we will implement the actual transition. We definitely welcome newcomers during this workshop (details will follow later). The online MEI Guidelines may be temporarily down for maintenance in that week. 
* Monday, 2020-11-16: *Contributions welcome*: If all goes well, we will be able to accept contributions again :) 

We believe that this transition is in the interest of everyone using MEI, and try to minimize downtimes as much as possible. If you would like to learn more about the transition or would like to contribute, please [get in touch](https://music-encoding.org/community/community-contacts.html).

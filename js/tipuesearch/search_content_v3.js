A typical MEI document contains an mei element, which in turn contains metadata, represented by an meiHead element, and the musical text itself, represented by a music element. The meiHead element, formally declared in the MEI.header module, is described in chapter The MEI Header. Other variations on this basic form are also available for the representation of a: collection of related MEI-encoded texts, each with its own metadata, known as a corpus document that contain only metadata, known as an independent or stand-alone header music notation markup without metadata, typically intended to be embedded within another kind of markup, such as TEI Further information regarding the organization and encoding of music corpora is given in chapter Musical Corpora.

  "title": "Music Element",
  "text": "MEI texts may be regarded either as unitary; that is, forming an organic whole, or as composite; that is, consisting of several components which are in some important sense independent of each other. The distinction is not always entirely obvious. For example, a collection of songs might be regarded as a single item in some circumstances, or as a number of distinct items in others. In such borderline cases, the encoder must choose whether to treat the text as unitary or composite; each option may have advantages and disadvantages. Whether unitary or composite, the musical text is marked with the music tag and may contain front matter, a body, and back matter. In unitary texts, the body is tagged using the body element; in composite texts, however, where the textual body consists of a series of subordinate musical texts or other groups, it is tagged with the group element. The overall structure of any musical text, unitary or composite, is thus defined by the following elements: front (front matter) – Bundles prefatory text found before the start of the musical text. body Contains the whole of a single musical text, excluding any front or back matter. group Contains a composite musical text, grouping together a sequence of distinct musical texts (or groups of such musical texts) which are regarded as a unit for some purpose, for example, the collected works of a composer. back (back matter) – Contains any appendixes, advertisements, indexes, etc. following the main body of a musical text. Critical editions and collections of works often contain extensive text, such as a title page, table of contents, an introductory essay, commentary, biographical sketch, index, etc. These textual items may appear in either the front or back elements. The front and back elements, available only when the MEI.text module is activated, are described more fully in chapter Text in MEI. The overall structure of a single musical text is: &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;!-- metadata goes here --&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;front&gt; &lt;!-- front matter of text, if any, goes here --&gt; &lt;/front&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- body of text goes here --&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;back&gt; &lt;!-- back matter of text, if any, goes here --&gt; &lt;/back&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt; The top-level structure of a composite musical text made up of two unitary musical texts is: &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;!-- metadata for the composite musical text --&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;front&gt; &lt;!-- front matter for composite musical text --&gt; &lt;/front&gt; &lt;group&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;front&gt; &lt;!-- front matter of first unitary musical text, if any --&gt; &lt;/front&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- body of first unitary musical text --&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;back&gt; &lt;!-- back matter of first unitary musical text, if any --&gt; &lt;/back&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- body of second unitary musical text --&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/group&gt; &lt;back&gt; &lt;!-- back matter for composite musical text, if any --&gt; &lt;/back&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt;",

It is provided to simplify the encoding of collections, anthologies, and cyclic works. It can also be used to record the potentially complex internal structure of corpora, covered more fully in chapter Musical Corpora. group Contains a composite musical text, grouping together a sequence of distinct musical texts (or groups of such musical texts) which are regarded as a unit for some purpose, for example, the collected works of a composer. Examples of composite texts which may be represented using the group element include anthologies and other collections. The presence of common front matter referring to the whole collection, possibly in addition to front matter relating to each individual musical text, is a good indication that a given musical text might usefully be encoded in this way. For example, the overall structure of a collection of songs might be encoded as follows: &lt;music&gt; &lt;group&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- song 1 --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- song 2 --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;!-- additional songs here --&gt; &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/music&gt; A group of musical texts may contain other unitary and grouped texts: &lt;music&gt; &lt;group&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- song 1 --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;group&gt; &lt;!-- songs sharing one or more characteristics, treated as a group --&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- song 2 --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- song 3 --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/music&gt; The group element may be used to encode any kind of collection in which the constituents are regarded by the encoder as works in their own right, such as ad hoc single- or multiple-composer collections or anthologies of works not originally conceived of as a single composition.",

  "title": "Divisions of the Body",
  "text": "This section describes sub-division of the body of a musical text. Front and back matter are described in chapter Text in MEI. The body of a unitary musical text may contain one or more discrete, linear segments. The names commonly used for these structural subdivisions vary with the genre, style, and time period of the music, or even at the whim of the author, editor, or publisher. For example, a major subdivision of a symphony is generally referred to as a ‘movement’. An opera, on the other hand, is usually organized into ‘acts’ and then further by ‘scenes’. All such divisions are treated as occurrences of the same neutrally-named element, with a @type attribute used to categorize them independently of their hierarchic level. The following element is used to identify musical subdivisions. As a member of the class att.typed, the mdiv element has attributes which can be used to classify it according to a two-tier hierarchy. mdiv (musical division) – Contains a subdivision of the body of a musical text. @type Characterizes the element in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology. @subtype Provide any sub-classification for the element, additional to that given by its type attribute. To accommodate “divisions within divisions”, an mdiv element may contain additional mdiv sub-elements nested to any level required. For example, the encoding of a multi-movement work, such as a symphony, frequently have the following structure: &lt;body xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;mdiv type=\"symphony\"&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"movement\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of mvt 1 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"movement\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of mvt 2 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"movement\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of mvt 3 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"4\" type=\"movement\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of mvt 4 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/body&gt; while dramatic works, such as Verdi’s opera, Il Trovatore, often exhibit a more deeply-nested structure: &lt;body&gt; &lt;mdiv type=\"opera\"&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"I\" type=\"act\"&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act I, sc. 1 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act I, sc. 2--&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act I, sc. 3 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"II\" type=\"act\"&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act II, sc. 1 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act II, sc. 2 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act II, sc. 3 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"4\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act II, sc. 4 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"5\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act II, sc. 5 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"III\" type=\"act\"&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act III, sc. 1 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act III, sc. 2 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act III, sc. 3 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"IV\" type=\"act\"&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act IV, sc. 1 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act IV, sc. 2 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"&gt; &lt;!-- contents of act IV, sc. 3 --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/body&gt; Conventionally, in performance the musical structures represented by mdiv elements are separated by pauses; however, attacca, attacca subito, seque, or similar terms are sometimes used at the end of an mdiv to indicate that the next mdiv should begin immediately after the conclusion of the current one. These terms have no effect, however, on the logical segmentation of musical content using mdiv elements.",

},{
  "title": "Content of Musical Divisions",
  "text": "The mdiv element may contain one or both of two possible views: score and parts. score Full score view of the musical content. parts Provides a container for performers' parts. The score element represents notation in which all the parts of an ensemble are arranged on vertically aligned staves, while the parts element collects the individually notated parts for each performer or group of performers. The explicit encoding of these two ‘views’ is necessary because it is not always possible or desirable to automatically derive one view from the other. In addition, separating scores and parts can eliminate a great deal of markup complexity. &lt;body&gt; &lt;mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"movement\"&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;!-- markup of score goes here --&gt; &lt;/score&gt; &lt;parts&gt; &lt;!-- markup of performers’ parts goes here --&gt; &lt;/parts&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;!-- additional movements go here --&gt; &lt;/body&gt; The score and parts elements may also be employed to accommodate different methods of organizing the markup – with no particular presentation implied. In this case, software may render a collection of parts as a score or a score as a collection of parts. Within the collective parts element, notation for a single performer is represented by the part element: part An alternative visual rendition of the score from the point of view of a particular performer (or group of performers). A part is effectively a small-scale score, allowing all the encoding features of a full score, such as multiple staves, performance directives, and so on. A group of part element is useful for encoding performing parts when there is no score, such as in early music part books; when the parts have non-aligning bar lines; when different layout features, such as page turns, are needed for the score and parts; or for accommodating software that requires part-by-part encoding. Please note that part elements in MEI are not an indication of voice leading or staff grouping. Voice leading can be encoded using the @next attribute, available on all the members of the model.eventLike class. The staffGrp element handles grouping of staves in the score context. &lt;parts&gt; &lt;part label=\"Violin 1\"&gt; &lt;!-- first performer’s part --&gt; &lt;/part&gt; &lt;part label=\"Violin 2\"&gt; &lt;!-- second performer’s part --&gt; &lt;/part&gt; &lt;!-- additional performers’ parts --&gt; &lt;/parts&gt; In both score and part views, the scoreDef element is used to describe logical characteristics of the encoded music, such as key signature, the sounding key (as opposed to the notated key signature), meter, etc., and visual features, such as page size, staff groupings and display labels, etc. The staffGrp elements within scoreDef and the order of staffDef elements inside staffGrp should follow the score order of the source for the encoding. A part or score may be further divided into linear segments called “sections”. section Segment of music data. section elements are often used as a scoping mechanism for clef signs, key and meter signatures, as well as metronome, tempo, and expression markings. Using section elements can help to minimize the need for backward scanning to establish context when the starting point for access is not at the beginning of the score. section elements may also be used for other user-defined, i.e., analytical or editorial, purposes and may therefore be arbitrarily nested to any desired level. The ending element shares the same model as the section element. Unlike section, however, it may not be recursively nested. ending Alternative ending for a repeated passage of music; i.e., prima volta, seconda volta, etc. The most common (non-analytical, non-editorial) use of section and ending elements is illustrated below: &lt;music&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;!-- section one to be repeated --&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;ending n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- 1st ending --&gt; &lt;/ending&gt; &lt;ending n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;!-- 2nd ending --&gt; &lt;/ending&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;!-- next section --&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/score&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/music&gt; Within section elements, several methods of organization are possible, depending upon the notational style of the source material and the encoder’s needs. For example, when the MEI.cmn module is used, the default organization is measure-by-measure, with staff and layer sub-elements within each measure. Further discussion of CMN notation is continued in chapter Common Music Notation. However, staff-by-staff organization is more appropriate for music without measures and is provided when either the MEI.mensural or MEI.neumes module is employed. Coverage of mensural notation is provided in chapter Mensural Notation, while Neume Notation describes neumatic notation. It must be noted that, when both the MEI.cmn and MEI.mensural modules are available, it is possible to encode CMN notation without using measure elements; that is, staff-by-staff organization may be used and the ends of measures marked using barLine elements. In certain circumstances, this approach may be preferable for reproduction of the visual layout of the music. However, the simultaneous use of the measure and barLine elements may lead to confusion and should be avoided. Typically, MEI follows the order of sections as they appear in the document being encoded. When performance requires a different order, for instance in the case of D.C. and D.S. directives, the following element may be used to define the performance order. expansion Indicates how a section may be programmatically expanded into its 'through-composed' form. In the following example, expansion is used to indicate how the notated sections should be ordered in a “through-composed” rendition, for example for machine performance or analysis. The plist attribute contains an ordered list of identifiers of descendant section, ending, lem, or rdg elements. The sequence of values in the plist attribute indicates that the section labelled ‘A’ comes first, then the section labelled ‘B’, followed by the ‘A’ section again. This mechanism must be specified independently of any textual directives, such as “Da capo” or “D.S. al Fine”, that may be present in the document. &lt;music&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;expansion plist=\"#shared.A #shared.B #shared.A\"&gt;&lt;/expansion&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"shared.A\"&gt; &lt;!-- \"A\" section --&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"shared.B\"&gt; &lt;!-- \"B\" section --&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/score&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/music&gt;",

Often, a slur also indicates that the affected notes should be played in a legato manner. Even so, it is common for both of these concepts to be referred to generically as “slurs”.

In addition, text decoration, direction, and enclosing ‘boxes’ may be captured. While @rend is used to record relative font size and weight, absolute values for these qualities (measured in printers points) should be specified using the @fontsize and @fontweight attibutes. In addition to commonly found typographical qualities, MEI provides the @altrend attribute for the capture of additional, user-defined rendition information. rend (render) – A formatting element indicating special visual rendering, e.g., bold or italicized, of a text word or phrase. @rend Captures the appearance of the element's contents using MEI-defined descriptors. @altrend Used to extend the values of the rend attribute. @fontname Holds the name of a font. @fontsize Indicates the size of a font expressed in printers' points, i.e., 1/72nd of an inch, relative terms, e.g., \"small\", \"larger\", etc., or percentage values relative to \"normal\" size, e.g., \"125%\". @fontstyle Records the style of a font, i.e, italic, oblique, or normal. @fontweight Used to indicate bold type.",

The bibl element may contain a mix of text and more specific elements, including the following: arranger A person or organization who transcribes a musical composition, usually for a different medium from that of the original; in an arrangement the musical substance remains essentially unchanged. author The name of the creator of the intellectual content of a non-musical, literary work. composer The name of the creator of the intellectual content of a musical work. librettist Person or organization who is a writer of the text of an opera, oratorio, etc. lyricist Person or organization who is a writer of the text of a song. funder Names of individuals, institutions, or organizations responsible for funding. Funders provide financial support for a project; they are distinct from sponsors, who provide intellectual support and authority. sponsor Names of sponsoring individuals, organizations or institutions. Sponsors give their intellectual authority to a project; they are to be distinguished from funders, who provide the funding but do not necessarily take intellectual responsibility. respStmt (responsibility statement) – Names one or more individuals, groups, or in rare cases, mechanical processes, responsible for creation or realization of the intellectual or artistic content. title Title of a bibliographic entity. edition (edition designation) – A word or text phrase that indicates a difference in either content or form between the item being described and a related item previously issued by the same publisher/distributor (e.g. 2nd edition, version 2.0, etc.), or simultaneously issued by either the same publisher/distributor or another publisher/distributor (e.g. large print edition, British edition, etc.). editor The name of the individual(s), institution(s) or organization(s) acting in an editorial capacity. series Contains information about the serial publication in which a bibliographic item has appeared. imprint Information relating to the publication or distribution of a bibliographic item. pubPlace (publication place) – Name of the place where a bibliographic item was published. publisher Name of the organization responsible for the publication of a bibliographic item. distributor Person or agency, other than a publisher, from which access (including electronic access) to a bibliographic entity may be obtained. biblScope (scope of citation) – Defines the scope of a bibliographic reference, for example as a list of page numbers, or a named subdivision of a larger work. extent Used to express size in terms other than physical dimensions, such as number of pages, number of records in file, number of bytes, performance duration for music, audio recordings and visual projections, etc. date A string identifying a point in time or the time period between two such points. identifier An alpha-numeric string that establishes the identity of the described material. annot (annotation) – Provides a short statement explaining the text or indicating the basis for an assertion. creation Non-bibliographic details of the creation of an intellectual entity, in narrative form, such as the date, place, and circumstances of its composition. More detailed information may be captured within the history element. genre Term or terms that designate a category characterizing a particular style, form, or content. recipient The name of the individual(s), institution(s) or organization(s) receiving correspondence. textLang (text language) – Identifies the languages and writing systems within the work described by a bibliographic description, not the language of the description. repository Institution, agency, or individual which holds a bibliographic item. physLoc (physical location) – Groups information about the current physical location of a bibliographic item, such as the repository in which it is located and its shelf mark(s), and its previous locations. relatedItem (related item) – Contains or references another bibliographic item which is related to the present one. These elements fall into the following categories: identification of the bibliographic entity and those responsible for its intellectual content publication and distribution data for the bibliographic entity description of the physical characteristics of the item annotation of the bibliographic citation and additional details regarding the item’s intellectual content The elements title, edition, series, and identifier fall into the first category as do the elements arranger, author, composer, librettist, lyricist, funder, sponsor, and respStmt. The respStmt element is provided for marking responsibility roles that cannot be recorded using more specific elements. The biblScope element also carries information of an identifying nature. The identifier for a given item may be an International Standard Book/Music Number, Library of Congress Control Number, a publisher’s or plate number, a personal identification number, an entry in a bibliography or catalog, etc. To classify the title according to some convenient typology, the @type attribute may be used. Sample values include: main (main title), subordinate (subtitle, title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative (alternate title by which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title), uniform (collective title). The @type attribute is provided for convenience in analysing titles and processing them according to their type; where such specialized processing is not necessary, there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title, including subtitles and any parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single title element. Title parts may be encoded in title sub-elements. The name of the list from which a controlled value is taken may be recorded using the @authority attribute. Publication and distribution data may be captured using pubPlace, publisher, distributor, and date elements directly inside bibl when the citation is unstructured. However, these elements should be grouped within imprint whenever practical. The physical characteristics of the cited item may be described using the extent element. Annotation of the bibliographic citation and the provision of other pertinent details are addressed by several elements. Commentary on the bibliographic item or citation is accommodated by the annot and creation elements. The annot element is provided for generic comments, while creation is intended to hold information about the context of the creation of the cited item. Terms by which the bibliographic item can be classified may be placed in genre. For letters and other correspondence, recipient captures the name of the person or organization to whom the item was addressed. The natural language(s) of the item may be recorded in one or more textLang elements. Finally, a holding institution may be documented using the repository element directly within bibl, but physLoc should be used whenever possible as a grouping mechanism for location and shelfmark information. To identify sub-units of the holding institution, repository sub-elements may be used. The name of the list from which a controlled value for the agency name is taken may be recorded using the @authority attribute. When supplied with a @target attribute, bibl may function as a hypertext reference to an external electronic resource. In addition, other related bibliographic items may be described or referenced using the relatedItem element. &lt;bibl&gt; &lt;genre&gt;letter&lt;/genre&gt; &lt;author&gt;Carl Nielsen&lt;/author&gt; &lt;recipient&gt;Gustav Hetsch&lt;/recipient&gt; &lt;creation&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"1915-04-08\"&gt;1915-04-08&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/creation&gt; &lt;physLoc&gt; &lt;repository&gt; &lt;identifier authURI=\"http://www.rism.info/\" authority=\"RISM\"&gt;DK-Kk&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;/repository&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;CNA IAc&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;/physLoc&gt; &lt;relatedItem rel=\"host\"&gt; &lt;bibl xml:id=\"shared.bibl_d1e380372\"&gt; &lt;title&gt;CNB&lt;/title&gt; &lt;biblScope&gt;V/210&lt;/biblScope&gt; &lt;/bibl&gt; &lt;/relatedItem&gt; &lt;/bibl&gt; Please consult Names, Dates, Numbers, Abbreviations, and Addresses and Names and Dates for more information about recording the names and dates frequently found in bibliographic citations.",

The kind of relation is expressed using the @rel attribute. It describes the relationship of the child bibl to the relatedItem’s parent bibl. @rel Describes the relationship between the &lt;relatedItem&gt; and the resource described in the parent element, i.e., &lt;bibl&gt;, &lt;source&gt; or &lt;relatedItem&gt;. The values are based on MODS version 3.4. The subject of these relations is always the &lt;relatedItem&gt;, and the object is always the parent of the &lt;relatedItem&gt;. \"preceding\" and \"succeeding\" indicate temporal order. In these relations, the subject is always the relatedItem, and the object is always the parent of the relatedItem. Thus, a value of @rel=”preceding” indicates that the resource described within the relatedItem (or referenced by its @target attribute) precedes the bibl containing the relatedItem. Following MODS, both values of “preceding” and “succeeding” indicate a temporal order. It is important not to confuse relatedItem with the concepts of Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR); see RelatedItem vs. FRBR.",

  "title": "Common Attributes",
  "text": "The following attributes, provided by the att.common attribute class, are available on nearly all elements in an MEI encoding. They provide the means to identify, label, and access elements in MEI-encoded files. @n Provides a number-like designation for an element. @xml---id Regularizes the naming of an element and thus facilitates building links between it and other resources. Each id attribute within a document must have a unique value. @xml---base Provides a base URI reference with which applications can resolve relative URI references into absolute URI references. @label Provides a name or label for an element. The value may be any string. The value of the @xml:id attribute serves as an identifier for an element and its content. Its value must be unique in the context of the current document and must conform to the definition of an XML Name provided by the W3C Recommendation at http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name. Suggestions for constructing an ID value can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-suggested-names. The @xml:id attribute may take values similar to the following: &lt;!-- The following are all valid IDs. --&gt;&lt;note xml:id=\"n1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"_n1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"thisIsMyFavoriteNote\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"shared.thisIsMyFavoriteNote\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; This is an example of an incorrectly-formulated @xml:id value: &lt;!-- xml:id not valid as IDs are not allowed to start with a number. --&gt;&lt;note xml:id=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; The @label and @n attributes both serve a labeling function; however, they differ in the values they allow. The @n attribute must be a single token, while @label may contain a string value that includes spaces. This makes @label useful for the capture of free-text labels, but a name or number specified with @n may be easier to process. &lt;!-- Example of a @label containing whitespace: --&gt;&lt;mdiv label=\"Allegro moderato\"&gt;…&lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;!-- Example of a processable @n attribute: --&gt; &lt;measure n=\"42\"&gt; &lt;!--…--&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; When a reference to an external entity is not a complete URI, the @xml:base attribute can record a value against which it can be resolved into a complete, or absolute, location. &lt;graphic target=\"myImage.jpg\" xml:base=\"http://www.mySite.org/images/\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; The value of @xml:base can be inherited from an ancestor. In the following example, the values of the graphic elements’ @target attribute can be completed by the xml:base value specified for the facsimile element: &lt;facsimile xml:base=\"http://www.mySite.org/images/\"&gt; &lt;surface&gt; &lt;graphic target=\"myImage.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;graphic target=\"myImage.tif\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;/surface&gt; &lt;/facsimile&gt; See http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/ for more details on xml:base.",

  "title": "The MEI Header",
  "text": "This chapter addresses the description of an encoded item so that the musical text, as well as its sources, encoding, and revisions are all thoroughly documented. Such documentation is necessary for scholars using the texts, for software processing them, and for catalogers in libraries and archives. Together these descriptions and declarations provide an electronic analog to the title page attached to a printed work. They also constitute an equivalent for the content of the code books or introductory manuals customarily accompanying electronic data sets. Every MEI-conformant text not embedded in another XML carrier that provides for capturing metadata, such as TEI or METS, must carry a set of descriptions, prefixed to it and encoded as described in this chapter. This set is known as the MEI header, tagged meiHead, and has five major parts: one or more alternative identifiers, tagged with altId, each of which provides an identifying name or number associated with the file. a file description, tagged fileDesc, containing a full bibliographic description of the computer file itself, from which a user of the text could derive a proper bibliographic citation, or which a librarian or archivist could use in creating a catalog entry recording its presence within a library or archive. The term computer file here is to be understood as referring to the whole intellectual entity or document described by the header, even when this is stored in multiple physical operating system files. The file description also includes information about the source or sources from which the electronic document was derived. The MEI elements used to encode the file description are described in section File Description below. an encoding description, tagged encodingDesc, which describes the relationship between an electronic text and its source or sources. It allows for detailed description of whether (or how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the encoder resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis were applied, and similar matters. The MEI elements used to encode the encoding description are described in section Encoding Description below. a work description, tagged workDesc, containing classification and contextual information about the work, such as its subject matter, the situation in which it was produced, the individuals described by or participating in producing it, and so forth. Such a work profile is of particular use in highly structured composite texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly desirable to enforce a controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform retrievals from a body of text in terms of text type or origin. The work description may however be of use in any form of automatic text processing. The MEI elements used to encode the work description are described in section Work Description below. a revision history, tagged revisionDesc, which allows the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the development of the electronic text. The revision history is important for version control and for resolving questions about the history of a file. The MEI elements used to encode the revision description are described in section Revision Description below.",

  "title": "File Description",
  "text": "The structure of the bibliographic description of a machine-readable or digital musical text resembles that of a book, an article, or other kinds of textual objects. The file description element of the MEI header has therefore been closely modelled on existing standards in library cataloging; it should thus provide enough information to allow users to give standard bibliographic references to the electronic text, and to allow catalogers to catalog it. Bibliographic citations occurring elsewhere in the header, and in the text itself, are derived from the same model. The bibliographic description of an electronic musical text should be supplied by the mandatory fileDesc element: fileDesc (file description) – Contains a full bibliographic description of the MEI file. The fileDesc element contains two mandatory and six optional elements, each of which is described in more detail below. These elements are listed below in the order in which they must occur within the fileDesc element. titleStmt (title statement) – Container for title and responsibility meta-data. editionStmt (edition statement) – Container for meta-data pertaining to a particular edition of the material being described. extent Used to express size in terms other than physical dimensions, such as number of pages, number of records in file, number of bytes, performance duration for music, audio recordings and visual projections, etc. pubStmt (publication statement) – Container for information regarding the publication or distribution of a bibliographic item, including the publisher's name and address, the date of publication, and other relevant details. seriesStmt (series statement) – Groups information about the series, if any, to which a publication belongs. notesStmt (notes statement)– Collects any notes providing information about a text additional to that recorded in other parts of the bibliographic description. sourceDesc (source description) – A container for the descriptions of the source(s) used in the creation of the electronic file. A complete file description will resemble the following example: &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;!-- title of the resource --&gt; &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;editionStmt&gt; &lt;!-- information about the edition of the resource --&gt; &lt;/editionStmt&gt; &lt;extent&gt; &lt;!-- description of the size of the resource --&gt; &lt;/extent&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;!-- information about the publication and distribution of the resource --&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;seriesStmt&gt; &lt;!-- information about any series to which the resource belongs --&gt; &lt;/seriesStmt&gt; &lt;notesStmt&gt; &lt;annot&gt; &lt;!-- notes on other aspects of the resource --&gt; &lt;/annot&gt; &lt;/notesStmt&gt; &lt;sourceDesc&gt; &lt;!-- information about the source(s) from which the resource was derived --&gt; &lt;/sourceDesc&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt;",

  "title": "Title Statement",
  "text": "The titleStmt element is the first component of the fileDesc element, and is mandatory: titleStmt (title statement) – Container for title and responsibility meta-data. The title statement contains the title given to the electronic work, together with one or more optional statements of responsibility which identify the encoder, editor, author, compiler, or other parties responsible for it: title Title of a bibliographic entity. arranger A person or organization who transcribes a musical composition, usually for a different medium from that of the original; in an arrangement the musical substance remains essentially unchanged. author The name of the creator of the intellectual content of a non-musical, literary work. composer The name of the creator of the intellectual content of a musical work. editor The name of the individual(s), institution(s) or organization(s) acting in an editorial capacity. funder Names of individuals, institutions, or organizations responsible for funding. Funders provide financial support for a project; they are distinct from sponsors, who provide intellectual support and authority. librettist Person or organization who is a writer of the text of an opera, oratorio, etc. lyricist Person or organization who is a writer of the text of a song. sponsor Names of sponsoring individuals, organizations or institutions. Sponsors give their intellectual authority to a project; they are to be distinguished from funders, who provide the funding but do not necessarily take intellectual responsibility. respStmt (responsibility statement) – Names one or more individuals, groups, or in rare cases, mechanical processes, responsible for creation or realization of the intellectual or artistic content. The title element contains the chief name of the electronic work. Its content takes the form considered appropriate by its creator. The element may be repeated, if the work has more than one title (perhaps in different languages). Where the electronic work is derived from an existing source text, it is strongly recommended that the title for the former should be derived from the latter, but clearly distinguishable from it, for example by the addition of a phrase such as ‘: an electronic transcription’ or ‘a digital edition’. This will distinguish the electronic work from the source text in citations and in catalogs, which contain descriptions of both types of material. &lt;titleStmt xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;title&gt;Lieder-Album für die Jugend&lt;/title&gt; &lt;title type=\"subtitle\"&gt;für Singstimme(n) und Klavier, &lt;identifier&gt;op. 79&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;/title&gt; &lt;title type=\"subtitle\"&gt;an electronic transcription&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; Other alternative titles or subtitles may be encoded in additional title elements with values in the @type attribute that distinguish them from the chief title. Sample values for the @type attribute include: main (main title), subordinate (subtitle, title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative (alternate title by which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title), uniform (collective title). The @type attribute is provided for convenience in analyzing titles and processing them according to their type; where such specialized processing is not necessary, there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title, including subtitles and any parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single title element, as in the following example: &lt;title&gt;Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription&lt;/title&gt; The electronic work will also have an external name (its ‘filename’ or ‘data set name’) or reference number on the computer system where it resides at any time. This name is likely to change frequently, as new copies of the file are made on the computer system. Its form is entirely dependent on the particular computer system in use and thus cannot always easily be transferred from one system to another. Moreover, a given work may be composed of many files. For these reasons, these Guidelines strongly recommend that such names should not be used as the title for any electronic work. Helpful guidance on the formulation of useful descriptive titles in difficult cases may be found in the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (Gorman and Winkler, 1978, chapter 25) or in equivalent national-level bibliographical documentation. At a minimum, the creator of the musical text and the creator of the file should be identified. If the bibliographic description is for a corpus, identify the creator of the corpus. Optionally also include the names of others involved in the transcription or elaboration of the text, sponsors, and funding agencies. The name of the person responsible for physical data input need not normally be recorded, unless that person is also intellectually responsible for some aspect of the creation of the file. In traditional bibliographic practice, those with primary creative responsibility are given special prominence. MEI accommodates this approach by providing responsibility-role elements. For example: &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Auf dem Hügel sitz ich spähend : an electronic transcription&lt;/title&gt; &lt;composer&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/composer&gt; &lt;lyricist&gt;Aloys Jeitteles&lt;/lyricist&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; Secondary intellectual responsibility in this case is encoded using respStmt. The respStmt element has two subcomponents: a name element identifying a responsible individual or organization, and a resp element indicating the nature of the responsibility. All names should be stated in the form in which the persons or bodies wish to be publicly cited. This will usually be the fullest form of the name, including first names. No specific recommendations are made at this time as to appropriate content for resp. However, it should make clear the nature of the responsibility. &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Auf dem Hügel sitz ich spähend : an electronic transcription&lt;/title&gt; &lt;composer&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/composer&gt; &lt;lyricist&gt;Aloys Jeitteles&lt;/lyricist&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Encoded by&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;name&gt;Maja Hartwig&lt;/name&gt; &lt;name&gt;Kristina Richts&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; This method of encoding facilitates exchange of bibliographic data with library catalogs and bibliographic databases as well as applications whose handling of bibliographic data is restricted to traditional responsibility roles. Additional information regarding these responsibility-role elements can be found in chapter Bibliographic Citations and References. When the MEI.namesdates module is enabled, two additional elements are also permitted within respStmt: corpName (corporate name) – Identifies an organization or group of people that acts as a single entity. persName (personal name) – Designation for an individual, including any or all of that individual's forenames, surnames, honorific titles, and added names. These elements allow for more precise identification of the entity associated with the name than is permitted by the simpler name element. The following example shows how a precise date range can be associated with a personal or corporate name. &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Machine-readable transcription by:&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;persName enddate=\"1940-11-06\" startdate=\"1860-01-01\"&gt;John Doe&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; For additional information about corporate and personal names, see chapter Names and Dates. In addition to, or instead of the resp element, the @role attribute on name, persName, and corpName may be used to capture the nature of responsibility. While resp accommodates capturing the wide variety of text that may occur in responsibility statements, use of the @role attribute provides the possibility of recording a controlled value independently of the textual content of resp. &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Encoded by&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;corpName role=\"encoder\"&gt;Members of the Local Symphony Orchestra&lt;/corpName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; Values from the MARC relator code list (http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html) or term list (http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html) are recommended for @role, where applicable. Where it is necessary to group responsibilities and names, multiple responsibility statements may be used. For example: &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription&lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Encoded by&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;persName role=\"encoder\"&gt;Joe Encoder&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName role=\"encoder\"&gt;Jane Decoder&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Images scanned by&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;persName&gt;Ludwig van Ludwig&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; It is often desirable to mix primary and secondary intellectual responsibility information. Treating all intellectual roles the same way can allow literal transcription of existing responsibility statements and simplify programmatic processing. The following example demonstrates how a responsibility statement may be transcribed using interleaved resp and persName elements: &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription&lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Composed by:&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;persName role=\"composer\"&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName role=\"encoder\"&gt;Johannes Jones:&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Machine-readable transcription&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; However, eliminating explanatory text and relying on standardized values for @role, as in the following example, allows data creation and processing tools of the greatest simplicity. &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription&lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;persName role=\"composer\"&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName role=\"editor\"&gt;Johannes Jones&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt;",

  "title": "Edition Statement",
  "text": "The editionStmt element is the second component of the fileDesc element. It is optional but recommended when applicable. editionStmt (edition statement) – Container for meta-data pertaining to a particular edition of the material being described. It contains elements for identifying the edition and those responsible for it: edition (edition designation) – A word or text phrase that indicates a difference in either content or form between the item being described and a related item previously issued by the same publisher/distributor (e.g. 2nd edition, version 2.0, etc.), or simultaneously issued by either the same publisher/distributor or another publisher/distributor (e.g. large print edition, British edition, etc.). respStmt (responsibility statement) – Names one or more individuals, groups, or in rare cases, mechanical processes, responsible for creation or realization of the intellectual or artistic content. For printed texts, the term ‘edition’ applies to the set of all the identical copies of an item produced from one master copy and issued by a particular publishing agency or a group of such agencies. A change in the identity of the distributing body or bodies does not normally constitute a change of edition, while a change in the master copy does. For electronic texts, the notion of a master copy is not entirely appropriate, since they are far more easily copied and modified than printed ones; nonetheless, the term edition may be used for a particular state of a machine-readable text at which substantive changes are made and fixed. Synonymous terms used in these Guidelines are version, level, and release. The words revision and update, by contrast, are used for minor changes to a file which do not amount to a new edition. No simple rule can specify how substantive changes have to be before they are regarded as producing a new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed here is that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. The addition of analytic coding to a text would thus constitute a new edition, while automatic conversion from one coded representation to another would not. Changes relating to the character code or physical storage details, corrections of misspellings, simple changes in the arrangement of the contents and changes in the output format do not normally constitute a new edition, whereas the addition of new information (e.g., annotations, sound or images, links to external data) almost always does. Clearly, there will always be borderline cases and the matter is somewhat arbitrary. The simplest rule is: if you think that your file is a new edition, then call it such. An edition statement is optional for the first release of a computer file; it is mandatory for each later release, though this requirement cannot be enforced. Note that all changes in a file, whether or not they are regarded as constituting a new edition or simply a revision, should be independently noted in the revision description section of the file header (see section Revision Description). The edition element should contain phrases describing the edition or version, including the word ‘edition’, ‘version’, or an equivalent term, together with a number or date, or terms indicating difference from other editions such as ‘new edition’, ‘revised edition’, etc. Any dates that occur within the edition statement should be marked with the date element. The @n attribute of the edition element may be used as elsewhere to supply any formal identification (such as a version number) for the edition. One or more respStmt elements may also be used to supply statements of responsibility for the edition in question. These may refer to individuals or corporate bodies and can indicate functions such as that of a reviser, or can name the person or body responsible for the provision of supplementary matter, of appendices, etc., in a new edition. Some examples follow: &lt;editionStmt&gt; &lt;edition n=\"Draft2\"&gt;Second draft, substantially extended, revised, and corrected.&lt;/edition&gt; &lt;/editionStmt&gt; &lt;editionStmt&gt; &lt;edition&gt;Student's edition, &lt;date&gt;June 1987&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/edition&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;New annotations by&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;name&gt;George Brown&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/editionStmt&gt;",

  "title": "Physical Description of the File",
  "text": "The third component of the fileDesc is a description of the physical qualities of the file. The extent element is provided for this purpose. extent Used to express size in terms other than physical dimensions, such as number of pages, number of records in file, number of bytes, performance duration for music, audio recordings and visual projections, etc. The extent element describes the approximate size of a text as stored on some carrier medium, whether digital or non-digital, specified in any convenient units. For printed books, information about the carrier, such as the kind of medium used and its size, are of great importance in cataloging procedures. The print-oriented rules for bibliographic description of an item’s medium and extent need some re-interpretation when applied to electronic media. An electronic file exists as a distinct entity quite independently of its carrier and remains the same intellectual object whether it is stored as file on a hard disc drive, a CD-ROM, a set of USB devices, or in the internet. Since, moreover, these Guidelines are specifically aimed at facilitating transparent document storage and interchange, any purely machine-dependent information should be irrelevant as far as the file header is concerned. This is particularly true of information about file-type although library-oriented rules for cataloging often distinguish two types of computer file: ‘data’ and ‘programs’. This distinction is quite difficult to draw in some cases, for example, hypermedia or texts with built-in search and retrieval software. Although it is equally system-dependent, some measure of the size of the computer file may be of use for cataloging and other practical purposes. Because the measurement and expression of file size is fraught with difficulties, only very general recommendations are possible; the element extent should contain a phrase indicating the size or approximate size of the computer file in one of the following ways: in bytes of a specified length (e.g. ‘4000 bytes’) as falling within a range of values, for example: less than 1 Mb between 1 Mb and 5 Mb between 6 Mb and 10 Mb over 10 Mb in terms of any convenient logical units (for example, words or sentences, citations, paragraphs) in terms of any convenient physical units (for example, compact discs, removable hard drives, DVDs) The use of standard abbreviations for units of quantity is recommended where applicable, here as elsewhere (see http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html). &lt;extent&gt;between 1 MB and 2 MB&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;extent&gt;4.2 MiB&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;extent&gt;4532 Mbytes&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;extent&gt;3200 sentences&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;extent&gt;5 90-mm high density diskettes&lt;/extent&gt; For ease of processability, the use of the @unit attribute is recommended, as in the following example: &lt;extent unit=\"sentence\"&gt;3200&lt;/extent&gt;",

If used, it contains one or more annot elements, each containing a single piece of descriptive information of the kind treated as ‘general notes’ in traditional bibliographic descriptions. notesStmt (notes statement)– Collects any notes providing information about a text additional to that recorded in other parts of the bibliographic description. Some information found in the notes area in conventional bibliography has been assigned specific elements in these Guidelines; in particular the following items should be tagged as indicated, rather than as general notes: the nature, scope, artistic form, or purpose of the work; also the genre or other intellectual category to which it may belong. These should be formally described within the workDesc element (section Work Description). bibliographic details relating to the source or sources of an electronic text: e.g., ‘Transcribed from a facsimile of the 1743 publication’. These should be formally described in the sourceDesc element (section Source Description). further information relating to publication, distribution, or release of the text, including sources from which the text may be obtained, any restrictions on its use or formal terms on its availability. These should be placed in the appropriate division of the pubStmt element (section Publication, Distribution, etc.). publicly documented numbers associated with the file should be placed in an altId element within the meiHead element. International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN), International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), and other internationally agreed upon standard numbers that uniquely identify an item, should be treated in the same way, rather than as specialized bibliographic notes. As described elsewhere, identifiers for sources of the file should be recorded within the sourceDesc. Nevertheless, the notesStmt element may be used to record potentially significant details about the file and its features, for example: dates, when they are relevant to the content or condition of the computer file: e.g. ‘manual dated 2010’, ‘file validated Apr 2011’ names of persons or bodies connected with the technical production, administration, or consulting functions of the effort which produced the file, if these are not named in statements of responsibility in the title or edition statements of the file description: e.g. ‘Historical commentary provided by members of the Big Symphony Orchestra’ availability of the file in an additional medium or information not already recorded about the availability of documentation: e.g. ‘User manual is loose-leaf in eleven paginated sections’ language of work and abstract, if not encoded in the langUsage element, e.g. ‘Text in English with stage directions in French and German’ Each such item of information may be tagged using the general-purpose annot element. Groups of annotations are contained within the notesStmt element, as in the following example: &lt;notesStmt&gt; &lt;annot&gt;Historical commentary provided by John Smith.&lt;/annot&gt; &lt;annot&gt;OCR scanning performed at University of Virginia.&lt;/annot&gt; &lt;/notesStmt&gt; There are advantages, however, to encoding such information with more precise elements elsewhere in the MEI header, when such elements are available.

An electronic file may also have no source, if what is being cataloged is an original text created in electronic form. sourceDesc (source description) – A container for the descriptions of the source(s) used in the creation of the electronic file. source A bibliographic description of a source used in the creation of the electronic file. The content model of the source element is similar to that of the fileDesc and work elements.

Sonata in B-flat major, Wq.62/1 (H.2)&lt;/annot&gt; &lt;/notesStmt&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;/sourceDesc&gt; However, more structured bibliographic data, such as that in the example below, facilitates better machine-processing: &lt;sourceDesc&gt; &lt;source xml:id=\"header.s1\"&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;1&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Sonata in B-flat major, &lt;identifier&gt;Wq. 62/1 (H.2)&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;name&gt;Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;pubPlace&gt;Paris&lt;/pubPlace&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;name&gt;A.

  "text": "It is sometimes convenient to store information relating to the processing of an encoded resource within its header. Typical uses for such information might be: to allow an application to discover that it has previously opened or edited a file, and what version of itself was used to do that; to show (through a date) which application last edited the file to allow for diagnosis of any problems that might have been caused by that application; to allow users to discover information about an application used to edit the file to allow the application to declare an interest in elements of the file which it has edited, so that other applications or human editors may be more wary of making changes to those sections of the file. For this, there is: application Provides information about an application which has acted upon the current document. @version Supplies a version number for an application, independent of its identifier or display name. Each application element identifies the current state of one software application with regard to the current file. This element is a member of the att.datable class, which provides a variety of attributes for associating this state with a date and time, or a temporal range. The @xml:id and @version attributes should be used to uniquely identify the application and its major version number (for example, ‘Music Markup Tool 1.5’). It is not intended that a software application should add a new application element each time it touches the file. The following example shows how these elements might be used to record the fact that version 1.5 of an application called ‘Music Markup Tool’ has an interest in two parts of a document. The parts concerned are accessible at the URLs given as targets of the two ptr elements. When used on application, the @date attribute specifies when the application was employed, in this case June 6, 2011. Version information for the application should be placed in @version. &lt;appInfo&gt; &lt;application isodate=\"2011-06-06\" version=\"1.5\" xml:id=\"header.MusicMarkupTool\"&gt; &lt;name&gt;Music Markup Tool&lt;/name&gt; &lt;ptr target=\"#header.P1\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;ptr target=\"#header.P2\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;/application&gt; &lt;/appInfo&gt;",

Some of these policy elements carry attributes to support automated processing of certain well-defined editorial decisions; all of them contain a prose description of the editorial principles adopted with respect to the particular feature concerned. Examples of the kinds of questions which these descriptions are intended to answer are given in the list below. correction: correctionStates how and under what circumstances corrections have been made in the text. corrlevelIndicates the degree of correction applied to the text. methodIndicates the method employed to mark corrections and normalizations. Was the text corrected during or after data capture? If so, were corrections made silently or are they marked using the tags described in chapter 11 Editorial Markup? What principles have been adopted with respect to omissions, truncations, dubious corrections, alternate readings, false starts, repetitions, etc.? interpretation: interpretationDescribes the scope of any analytic or interpretive information added to the transcription of the music. Has any analytic or ‘interpretive’ information been provided — that is, information which is felt to be non-obvious, or potentially contentious? If so, how was it generated? How was it encoded? normalization: normalizationIndicates the extent of normalization or regularization of the original source carried out in converting it to electronic form. methodIndicates the method employed to mark corrections and normalizations. Was the text normalized, for example by regularizing any non-standard enharmonic spellings, etc.? If so, were normalizations performed silently or are they marked using the tags described in chapter 11 Editorial Markup ? What authority was used for the regularization? Also, what principles were used when normalizing numbers to provide the standard values for the value attribute described in section 1.3.4 Names, Dates, Numbers, Abbreviations, and Addresses and what format is used for them? segmentation: segmentationDescribes the principles according to which the musical text has been segmented, for example into movements, sections, etc. How is the musical text segmented? If mdiv and/or section elements have been used to partition the music for analysis, how are they marked and how was the segmentation arrived at? standard values: stdVals(standard values) – Specifies the format used when standardized date or number values are supplied. In most cases, attributes bearing standardized values should conform to a defined datatype. In cases where this is not appropriate, this element may be used to describe the standardization methods underlying the values supplied.

The termList element categorizes an individual text by supplying a set of terms which may describe its topic or subject matter, its physical or intellectual form, date, etc. Each term is indicated by a term element. In some schemes, the order of items in the list is significant, for example, from major topic to minor; in others, the list has an organized substructure of its own. No recommendations are made here as to which method is to be preferred. Wherever possible, such terms should be taken from a recognized source.

Its use is optional but highly recommended. It provides essential information for the administration of large numbers of files which are being updated, corrected, or otherwise modified as well as extremely useful documentation for files being passed from researcher to researcher or system to system. Without change logs, it is easy to confuse different versions of a file, or to remain unaware of small but important changes made in the file by some earlier link in the chain of distribution. No change should be made in any MEI-conformant file without corresponding entries being made in the change log. revisionDesc (revision description) – Container for information about alterations that have been made to an MEI file. change Individual change within the revision description. The main purpose of the revision description is to record changes in the text to which a header is prefixed. However, it is recommended practice to include entries also for significant changes in the header itself (other than the revision description itself, of course). At the very least, an entry should be supplied indicating the date of creation of the header. The log consists of a list of change elements, each of which contains a detailed description of the changes made. If a number is to be associated with one or more changes (for example, a revision number), the @n attribute may be used to indicate it. The person responsible for the change and the date of the change may be indicated by the respStmt and date elements. The description of the change itself is contained within the changeDesc element, which can hold one or more paragraphs. It is recommended to give changes in reverse chronological order, most recent first. For example: &lt;revisionDesc&gt; &lt;change n=\"4\"&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;persName&gt;KR&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;changeDesc&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cleaned up MEI file automatically using Header.xsl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/changeDesc&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"2011-12-01\"&gt;&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/change&gt; &lt;change n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;persName&gt;KR&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;changeDesc&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cleaned up MEI file automatically using ppq.xsl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/changeDesc&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"2011-10-21\"&gt;&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/change&gt; &lt;/revisionDesc&gt; A slightly shorter form for recording changes is also available when a the date of the change can be described by a single date in a standard ISO form and when the name of the agent(s) responsible for the change, encoded elsewhere in the header, can be referred to by one or more URIs given in the @resp attribute. For example: &lt;change isodate=\"2011-10-21\" n=\"3\" resp=\"#KR #MH\"&gt; &lt;changeDesc&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cleaned up MEI file automatically using ppq.xsl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/changeDesc&gt; &lt;/change&gt;",

  "title": "Minimal and Recommended Header Information",
  "text": "The MEI header allows for the provision of a very large amount of information concerning the text itself, its source, its encodings, and revisions of it, as well as a wealth of descriptive information, such as the languages it uses and the situation(s) in which it was produced, together with the setting and identity of participants within it. This diversity and richness reflects the diversity of uses to which it is envisaged that electronic texts conforming to these Guidelines will be put. It is emphatically not intended that all of the elements described above should be present in every MEI Header. The amount of encoding in a header will depend both on the nature and the intended use of the text. At one extreme, an encoder may expect that the header will be needed only to provide a bibliographic identification of the text adequate to local needs. At the other, wishing to ensure that their texts can be used for the widest range of applications, encoders will want to document as explicitly as possible both bibliographic and descriptive information, in such a way that no prior or ancillary knowledge about the text is needed in order to process it. The header in such a case will be very full, approximating the kind of documentation often supplied in the form of a manual. Most texts will lie somewhere between these extremes; textual corpora in particular will tend more to the latter extreme. In the remainder of this section we demonstrate first the minimal, and then a commonly recommended, level of encoding for the bibliographic information held by the MEI header. Supplying only the level of encoding required, the MEI header of a single text will look like the following example: &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Fughette (in Gottes Namen Fahren wir - Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebote) for Brass Quintett : an electronic transcription &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;corpName authURI=\"http://d-nb.info/gnd\" authority=\"GND\" dbkey=\"5115204-6\"&gt;Musikwissenschaftliches Seminar &amp;lt;Detmold&amp;gt;&lt;/corpName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; The only mandatory component of the MEI Header is the fileDesc element. Within this element, titleStmt and pubStmt are required constituents. Within the title statement, a title is required. Within the pubStmt, a publisher, distributor, or other agency responsible for the file is required. While not formally required, additional information is recommended for a minimally effective header. For example, it is recommended that the person or corporate entity responsible for the creation of the encoding should be specified using respStmt within the titleStmt element. It is also recommended that information about the source, or sources, of the encoding be included. Each source element should contain at the least a loosely structured bibliographic citation that identifies the source used to construct the MEI file. Furthermore, If the electronic transcription is a member of a series of publications, the series title and publisher should be included using the seriesStmt element. It is also common for cataloging records to include genre and/or form information, here represented by the MEI classification element. We now present the same example header, expanded to include additionally recommended information, adequate for most bibliographic purposes, in particular to allow for the creation of an AACR2-conformant bibliographic record. &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Fughette (in Gottes Namen Fahren wir - Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebote) for Brass Quintett : an electronic transcription &lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;resp&gt;Encoded by:&lt;/resp&gt; &lt;persName xml:id=\"header.MH\"&gt;Maja Hartwig&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName xml:id=\"header.KR\"&gt;Kristina Richts&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;corpName&gt;Musikwissenschaftliches Seminar &amp;lt;Detmold&amp;gt;&lt;/corpName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;date&gt;2011&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;seriesStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;MEI Sample Collection&lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;corpName role=\"publisher\"&gt;MEI Project&lt;/corpName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/seriesStmt&gt; &lt;sourceDesc&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Fughette (in Gottes Namen Fahren wir - Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebote) for Brass Quintett &lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;persName role=\"composer\"&gt;Johann Christoph Bach&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName role=\"arranger\"&gt;Michel Rondeau&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;identifier type=\"URI\"&gt;http://icking-music-archive.org/scores/j.chr.bach/JCBIN-xml.zip&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"2011-10-13\"&gt;&lt;/date&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;name&gt;Werner Icking Music Archive&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;availability&gt; &lt;useRestrict&gt;© 2010 - Gatineau,Qc.Ca.&lt;/useRestrict&gt; &lt;/availability&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;classification&gt; &lt;classCode authURI=\"http://www.oclc.org/dewey/resources/summaries/default.htm#700\" authority=\"OCLC\" xml:id=\"header.OCLC_DDC\"&gt;&lt;/classCode&gt; &lt;termList&gt; &lt;term classcode=\"#header.OCLC_DDC\"&gt;785.15&lt;/term&gt; &lt;/termList&gt; &lt;/classification&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;/sourceDesc&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt;",

  "text": "Many libraries, repositories, research sites and related institutions collect bibliographic and documentary information about machine readable music documents without necessarily collecting the music documents themselves. Such institutions may thus want access to the header of an MEI document without its attached text in order to build catalogs, indexes and databases that can be used to locate relevant texts at remote locations, obtain full documentation about those texts, and learn how to obtain them. This section describes a set of practices by which the metadata headers of MEI documents can be encoded separately from those documents and exchanged as freestanding MEI documents. Headers exchanged independently of the documents they describe are called independent headers.",

  "title": "Definition and Principles for Encoders",
  "text": "An independent header is an MEI metadata header that can be exchanged as an independent document between libraries, archives, collections, projects, and individuals. The structure of an independent header is exactly the same as that of an header attached to a document. This means that an meiHead can be extracted from an MEI document and sent to a receiving institution with little or no change. When deciding which information to include in the independent header, and the format or structure of that information, the following should be kept in mind: The independent header should provide full bibliographic information about the encoded text, its sources, where the text can be located, and any restrictions governing its use. The independent header should contain useful information about the encoding of the text itself. In this regard, it is highly recommended that the encoding description be as complete as possible. The Guidelines do not require that the encoding description be included in the header (since some simple transcriptions of small items may not require it), but in practice the use of a header without an encoding description would be severely limited. The independent header should be amenable to automatic processing, particularly for loading into databases and for the creation of publications, indexes, and finding aids, without undue editorial intervention on the part of the receiving institution. For this reason, two recommendations are made regarding the format or structure of the header: first, where there is a choice between a prose content model and one that contains a formal series of specialized elements, wherever possible and appropriate the specialized elements should be preferred to unstructured prose. Second, with respect to corpora, information about each of the texts within a corpus should be included in the overall corpus-level meiHead. That is, source information, editorial practices, encoding descriptions, and the like should be included in the relevant sections of the corpus meiHead, with pointers to them from the headers of the individual texts included in the corpus. There are three reasons for this recommendation: first, the corpus-level header will contain the full array of bibliographic and documentary information for each of the texts in a corpus, and thus be of great benefit to remote users, who may have access only to the independent header; second, such a layout is easier for the coder to maintain than searching for information throughout a text; and third, generally speaking, this practice results in greater overall consistency, especially with respect to bibliographic citations.",

  "text": "MEI offers two related concepts for capturing relations between bibliographic items. The model of relatedItem, as described in chapter Related Items of these Guidelines, is derived from MODS v3.4 (see documentation here). Its purpose in MEI is to encode bibliographic references between mostly “secondary” material, like reviews, articles, and so on. It may be used to provide cross-references between information encoded in different places of the header. However, relatedItem is less ideal for describing the relations between works, differing versions of these works, the sources in which those versions are transmitted, and where applicable the individual copies of a print. For these situations, it is strongly recommended to use the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) instead. This module is based on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, as specified by the IFLA. It allows a much finer description of relationships between such “primary” entities. For compatibility reasons, both models should not be confused or mixed under any circumstances.",

  "text": "MEI header information may refer to different levels of description of the encoded work: Some information may apply the work in all its various forms and realizations, e.g., the name of its composer. Other information may describe a certain version of the work, or a source such as the printed first edition, or only a single copy of that source. Core MEI limits the header information to two such levels of description: work and source, respectively. However, when the FRBR module is available more detailed descriptions are possible. With certain limitations, mainly due to the musical nature of the works encoded in MEI, the FRBR module adapts the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) as recommended by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) [http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records]. The IFLA’s FRBR model distinguishes four levels of abstraction, or entities: Work: FRBR defines a work as a “distinct intellectual or artistic creation”, an abstract entity because there is no single material object one can point to as the work. Expression: An expression is defined as “the intellectual or artistic realization of a work in the form of […] notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of such forms”. Expressions are also abstract entities. Manifestation: A manifestation is defined as “the physical embodiment of an expression of a work”, including, for instance, manuscripts, books, sound recordings, films, video recordings, CD-ROMs, multimedia kits, etc. The manifestation represents all the physical objects that bear the same characteristics, with respect to both intellectual content and physical form. Item: A single exemplar of a manifestation is called an item, e.g., a specific copy of a printed score. With manuscripts, item and manifestation levels are nearly identical. A manuscript may be regarded as a manifestation having only one item.",

  "title": "FRBR Entities in MEI",
  "text": "When the FRBR module is available, MEI offers four elements corresponding to the FRBR entities: work Provides a detailed description of a work, specifically its history, language use, and high-level musical attributes: key, tempo, meter, medium of performance, and intended duration. expression Intellectual or artistic realization of a work. source A bibliographic description of a source used in the creation of the electronic file. item Single instance or exemplar of a source/manifestation. The names of the MEI entities generally follow those of FRBR: the work element is a container for description at the FRBR “work” level, expression is for description at the FRBR “expression” level, and item holds FRBR “item” level description. The source element, however, is the MEI equivalent to FRBR “manifestation” level description. The name “source” is used because it is both shorter and more familiar than “manifestation” to users of existing bibliographic markup schemes. The work element has an optional child element to hold the expression elements: expressionList Gathers bibliographic expression entities. As expressionList is a container element for descriptions of different expressions of the same work, it may contain only expression elements. The content model of expression is similar to that of work. It does not, however, permit expressionList and audience elements. But it adds elements that aid identification and description of specific versions of a work: extent Used to express size in terms other than physical dimensions, such as number of pages, number of records in file, number of bytes, performance duration for music, audio recordings and visual projections, etc. scoreFormat Describes the type of score used to represent a musical composition (e.g., short score, full score, condensed score, close score, etc.). Since expressions, like works, are abstractions, their titles are often nebulous. Usually, however, the title of an expression is the same as the work it represents. When the relationship between a work and an expression is encoded hierarchically, the expression’s title element may be omitted with the assumption that it will be inherited from the work. If no title is provided for an expression, distinguishing characteristics must be provided in other elements, such as perfMedium, as in the following example: &lt;work xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Pavane pour une infante défunte&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;expressionList&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;perfMedium&gt; &lt;perfResList&gt; &lt;perfRes&gt;piano&lt;/perfRes&gt; &lt;/perfResList&gt; &lt;/perfMedium&gt; &lt;/expression&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;perfMedium&gt; &lt;perfResList&gt; &lt;perfRes&gt;orchestra&lt;/perfRes&gt; &lt;/perfResList&gt; &lt;/perfMedium&gt; &lt;/expression&gt; &lt;/expressionList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; Programmatic concatenation of the work title and one or more characteristics of the expression can be used to provide identification for the expression. For example, the expressions above may be identified by “Pavane pour une infante défunte (piano)” and “Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestra)”. In some cases, it may be helpful to assign a descriptive title to the expression, as illustrated below. The carrier of the manifestation is often a good source of this kind of descriptive text. &lt;work xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Pavane pour une infante défunte&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;expressionList&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Version for piano&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;perfMedium&gt; &lt;perfResList&gt; &lt;perfRes&gt;piano&lt;/perfRes&gt; &lt;/perfResList&gt; &lt;/perfMedium&gt; &lt;/expression&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Version for orchestra&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;perfMedium&gt; &lt;perfResList&gt; &lt;perfRes&gt;orchestra&lt;/perfRes&gt; &lt;/perfResList&gt; &lt;/perfMedium&gt; &lt;/expression&gt; &lt;/expressionList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Sonata No. 2&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;expressionList&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Live recording at Carnegie Hall&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;/expression&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Studio recording&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;/expression&gt; &lt;/expressionList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; itemList Gathers bibliographic item entities.

For example, a work element’s componentGrp element can only contain work elements, etc. In this way, the componentGrp element may be employed to describe composite works, as in the example below: &lt;work xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Der Ring des Nibelungen&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;componentGrp&gt; &lt;work&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Das Rheingold&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Die Walküre&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Siegfried&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Götterdämmerung&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;/componentGrp&gt; &lt;/work&gt; This technique can also be applied when a single intellectual source is comprised of multiple physical parts. In the following example, the choral parts were published in four physically separate “signatures”: &lt;source xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\" xml:id=\"source.printed_choral_parts\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Printed choral parts&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;publisher&gt;Horneman &amp;amp; Erslev&lt;/publisher&gt; &lt;pubPlace&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/pubPlace&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"1871\"&gt;1871&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;componentGrp&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Soprani&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;physDesc&gt; &lt;extent unit=\"pages\"&gt;4&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;/physDesc&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Alti&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;physDesc&gt; &lt;extent unit=\"pages\"&gt;4&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;/physDesc&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Tenori&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;physDesc&gt; &lt;extent unit=\"pages\"&gt;6&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;/physDesc&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Bassi&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;physDesc&gt; &lt;extent unit=\"pages\"&gt;6&lt;/extent&gt; &lt;/physDesc&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;/componentGrp&gt; &lt;/source&gt;",

  "title": "FRBR Relationships",
  "text": "FRBR defines a number of terms that describe how the basic entities relate to each other. MEI provides the following elements for this purpose. relationList Gathers bibliographic relation elements. relation A relation element describes the relationship between its parent and the object referenced by the relation element's target attribute. @rel Describes the relationship between the current entity and the target entity. The values follow FRBR (see http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/frbr/frbr_2008.pdf). Each of the four FRBR entity equivalents – the work, expression, source, and item elements – allows a list of such relationship descriptions as its last child element. relationList provides a container for individual relation elements. The nature of the relationship must be specified by the @rel attribute and the target of the relationship must be identified by the @target attribute. Since relations are bidirectional, they may be defined on both entities involved, using pairs of oppositely-directed relation descriptors. The following FRBR relations are allowed in MEI as values of the relation element’s @rel attribute (shown in pairs for clarity): hasSuccessor / isSuccessorOf hasSupplement / isSupplementOf hasComplement / isComplementOf hasSummarization / isSummarizationOf hasAdaptation / isAdaptationOf hasTransformation / isTransformationOf hasImitation / isImitationOf hasPart / isPartOf hasReproduction / isReproductionOf hasAbridgement / isAbridgementOf hasRevision / isRevisionOf hasTranslation / isTranslationOf hasArrangement / isArrangementOf hasAlternate / isAlternateOf hasReconfiguration / isReconfigurationOf hasRealization / isRealizationOf hasEmbodiment / isEmbodimentOf hasExemplar / isExemplarOf Some of these relationships are already implicitly expressed by the MEI structural model: FRBR defines an expression entity as a realization of a work, but as this relation is implied by the expressionList element’s child relationship to its parent work element, the hasRealization/isRealizationOf relation does not need to be explicitly declared. Likewise, it is not necessary to specify by means of relation elements that an item is an exemplar of the source described by its parent source element. This resembles the FRBR model, which knows 1:n relationships both between works and expressions, and manifestations and items. However, as FRBR allows n:n relations between expressions and manifestations (in MEI: sources), a hierarchical model based on the strucutre of XML is clearly insufficient to express all possible expression / manifestation combinations. It is therefore required to declare these relations explicitly. In FRBR terms, a manifestation / source is an embodiment of an expression. &lt;source xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Score, first edition&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;relationList&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"isEmbodimentOf\" target=\"#version_for_orchestra\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;/relationList&gt; &lt;/source&gt; Within the componentGrp element, the order of child elements implicitly describes a hasSuccessor/isSuccessorOf relationship between components, i.e. it defines a certain sequence such as the movements of a work. In other cases, relation elements may be needed to explicitly encode relationships not otherwise defined by encoding order or hierarchy. For instance, the hasReproduction/isReproductionOf relationship may be used to indicate that one source is a reprint of another. &lt;source xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;publisher&gt;Horneman &amp;amp; Erslev&lt;/publisher&gt; &lt;pubPlace&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/pubPlace&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"1874\"&gt;1874&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;relationList&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"isReproductionOf\" target=\"#source.printed_choral_parts\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;/relationList&gt; &lt;/source&gt; Moreover, the use of componentGrp implicitly defines a hasPart/isPartOf relationship between the componentGrp element’s parent and its child elements. Using the relationList and relation elements to define their relationship, the four component works in the “Der Ring des Nibelungen” example above could alternatively be encoded as sibling work elements to the “Ring” work element. &lt;workDesc xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;work xml:id=\"theRing\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Der Ring des Nibelungen&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;relationList&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#rheingold\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#walkuere\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#siegfried\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#goetterdaemmerung\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;/relationList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work xml:id=\"rheingold\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Das Rheingold&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;relationList&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;/relationList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work xml:id=\"walkuere\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Die Walküre&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;relationList&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;/relationList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work xml:id=\"siegfried\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Siegfried&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;relationList&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;/relationList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;work xml:id=\"goetterdaemmerung\"&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Götterdämmerung&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;relationList&gt; &lt;relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"&gt;&lt;/relation&gt; &lt;/relationList&gt; &lt;/work&gt; &lt;/workDesc&gt; Relations may also be used to point to external resources. For instance, each of the individual component works of the “Ring” could be encoded in separate files, with relations pointing to them.

  "title": "The Role of the Measure Element",
  "text": "Arguably, the most important element of the CMN module is the measure element. It is used as a structural unit inside section elements and acts as a container for ‘events’ from the model.eventLike class, such as notes, chords and rests as well as ‘control events’ from the model.controleventLike class, such as slurs and indications of dynamics. The following example demonstrates the use of the measure element: &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"1\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; A measure slices the flow of a score or part into chunks that normally comply with a duration determined by the meter defined within a preceding scoreDef or staffDef element. Each staff in the source material is represented by a staff element. As the order of the staff elements in the file does not have to reflect their order in the original document, to eliminate confusion they should always refer to a staffDef element, using either an @n or @def attribute. Whereas the @def attribute uses the xs:anyURI datatype, the @n value refers to the closest preceding staffDef or layerDef with the same value in its @n attribute. &lt;staffDef n=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn_staffDef1\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;!-- later in the file: --&gt; &lt;staff def=\"#cmn_staffDef1\"&gt; &lt;!-- @def refers to staffDef with this identifier --&gt; &lt;!-- staff content --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;!-- or: --&gt; &lt;staff n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;!-- @n refers to staffDef with this numeric label --&gt; &lt;!-- staff content --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; Each staff may hold a number of layer elements to reflect multiple ‘voices’. Just as with staff, the order of the layer elements in the file does not have to reflect their original order in the document, so they also possess @n and @def attributes for association with the appropriate layer definition. &lt;staffDef n=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn_staffDef1\"&gt; &lt;layerDef n=\"1\" xml:id=\"cmn_layerDef1\"&gt;&lt;/layerDef&gt; &lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;!-- later in the file: --&gt; &lt;staff def=\"#cmn_staffDef1\"&gt; &lt;layer def=\"#cmn_layerDef1\"&gt; &lt;!-- layer content --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;!-- OR: --&gt; &lt;staff n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- layer content --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt;",

  "title": "Defining Score Parameters for CMN",
  "text": "When encoding a score in CMN, MEI relies on the following elements from the Shared Elements, Models, and Attributes module: scoreDef (score definition) – Container for score meta-information. staffGrp (staff group) – A group of bracketed or braced staves. staffDef (staff definition) – Container for staff meta-information. layerDef (layer definition) – Container for layer meta-information. A scoreDef element is used to specify the common parameters of a score, e.g., key and meter. The most important attributes for this purpose are: @meter.count Captures the number of beats in a measure, that is, the top number of the meter signature. It must contain a decimal number or an additive expression that evaluates to a decimal number, such as 2+3. @meter.unit Contains the number indicating the beat unit, that is, the bottom number of the meter signature. @meter.sym Indicates the use of a meter symbol instead of a numeric meter signature, that is, 'C' for common time or 'C' with a slash for cut time. @key.pname Holds the pitch name of the tonic key, e.g. 'c' for the key of C. @key.accid Contains an accidental for the tonic key, if one is required, e.g., if key.pname equals 'c' and key.accid equals 's', then a tonic of C# is indicated. @key.mode Indicates major, minor, or other tonality. @key.sig Indicates where the key lies in the circle of fifths. The following example describes a score in common time with 3 flats: &lt;scoreDef key.sig=\"3f\" meter.count=\"4\" meter.sym=\"common\" meter.unit=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/scoreDef&gt; Other attributes allow the description of default page and system margins and fonts for text and music: @page.width Describes the width of the page; may be expressed in real-world units or staff steps. @page.height Specifies the height of the page; may be expressed in real-world units or staff steps. @page.leftmar Indicates the amount of whitespace at the left side of a page. @page.topmar Indicates the amount of whitespace at the top of a page. @page.rightmar Indicates the amount of whitespace at the right side of a page. @page.botmar Indicates the amount of whitespace at the bottom of a page. @system.leftmar Describes the amount of whitespace at the left system margin relative to page.leftmar. @system.topmar Describes the distance from page's top edge to the first system; used for first page only. @system.rightmar Describes the amount of whitespace at the right system margin relative to page.rightmar. @text.name Provides a default value for the font name of text (other than lyrics) when this information is not provided on the individual elements. @text.fam Provides a default value for the font family name of text (other than lyrics) when this information is not provided on the individual elements. @text.size Provides a default value for the font size of text (other than lyrics) when this information is not provided on the individual elements. @music.name Sets the default music font name. @music.size Sets the default music font size. @lyric.name Sets the font name default value for lyrics. @lyric.fam Sets the font family default value for lyrics. @lyric.size Sets the default font size value for lyrics. There are other attributes that allow the specification of many further details of a score. These are available from the element definitions accessible at scoreDef, staffDef, staffGrp and layerDef. When content is provided for scoreDef, it must contain a staffGrp element. This element is used to gather individual staves and other staff groups. This is useful for collecting instrumental or vocal groups in a large score, such as woodwinds, brasses, etc., and for assigning a shared label to the group, using the @label and @label.abbr attributes. The staffGrp element is also used for the two staves of a grand staff. The @barthru attribute on staffGrp allows one to specify whether barlines are drawn across the space between staves of that group or only on the staves themselves. A staffDef element is used to describe an individual staff of a score or performer part. It bears most of the attributes described above, including @label and @label.abbr for providing staff labels for the first and subsequent pages. Every staffDef must have an @n attribute with an integer as its value. The first occurence of a staffDef with a given number must also indicate the number of staff lines via the @lines attribute. The order of staffDef elements within scoreDef follows the order of staves in the source document or planned rendering. The individual staff elements within a measure refer to these staffDef declarations using their own @n attribute values. Therefore, the encoding order of staves within a measure does not have to mimic the order of the staffDef elements with scoreDef. In addition to the parameters inherited from scoreDef, the following attributes are important for staffDef elements: @clef.line Contains a default value for the position of the clef. The value must be in the range between 1 and the number of lines on the staff. The numbering of lines starts with the lowest line of the staff. @clef.shape Encodes a value for the clef symbol. @clef.dis Records the amount of octave displacement to be applied to the clef. @clef.dis.place Records the direction of octave displacement to be applied to the clef. A staff with a tenor clef is encoded as in the following example: &lt;staffDef clef.dis=\"8\" clef.dis.place=\"below\" clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; In the case of transposing instruments, the key-related attributes described above may be used to override the written key expressed in the scoreDef element. As a basic principle, MEI always captures written pitches, so the @trans.diat and @trans.semi attributes may be used to indicate the number of diatonic steps and semitones to calculate sounded pitch from written pitch. The piccolo and E♭ clarinet staves in the example below utilize these attributes: &lt;scoreDef meter.count=\"6\" meter.unit=\"8\"&gt; &lt;staffGrp&gt; &lt;!-- Piccolo sounds 12 semitones higher than written (and encoded in MEI). --&gt; &lt;staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" key.sig=\"4f\" label=\"Piccolo\" label.abbr=\"Picc.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"1\" trans.diat=\"0\" trans.semi=\"12\" xml:id=\"cmn.P1\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" key.sig=\"4f\" label=\"Flute\" label.abbr=\"Fl.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"2\" xml:id=\"cmn.P2\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" key.sig=\"4f\" label=\"Oboe\" label.abbr=\"Ob.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn.P3\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;staffDef clef.line=\"4\" clef.shape=\"F\" key.mode=\"major\" key.sig=\"4f\" label=\"Bassoon\" label.abbr=\"Bsn.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"4\" xml:id=\"cmn.P4\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;!-- Clarinet sounds a minor third (two diatonic steps or three semitones) higher than written. --&gt; &lt;staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" key.sig=\"1f\" label=\"Clarinet in E♭\" label.abbr=\"E♭ Cl.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"5\" trans.diat=\"2\" trans.semi=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn.P5\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;/staffGrp&gt; &lt;/scoreDef&gt; There are a number of additional elements that can be used as children of staffDef in order to describe additional features of the staff, such as the color of a clef or a key signature added in a different hand. These elements include: clef Indication of the exact location of a particular note on the staff and, therefore, the other notes as well. clefGrp (clef group) – A set of simultaneously-occurring clefs. keySig (key signature) – Written key signature. keyAccid (key accidental) – Accidental in a key signature. label A container for text that identifies the feature to which it is attached. meterSig (meter signature) – Written meter signature. meterSigGrp (meter signature group) – Used to capture alternating, interchanging, and mixed meter signatures. With the exception of label, these elements may also occur within the flow of musical events captured in a layer, since they are members of model.eventLike. In the layer context they function as milestones and affect all following content assigned to the layer (even in subsequent measures) until their information is again overridden either by the same element bearing different information or a staffDef or scoreDef. In this context, it is also possible to combine them with the elements described in chapters Critical Apparatus and Editorial Markup of these Guidelines. Such flexibility as this may require close inspection of an encoding to retrieve the correct definitions for a given staff. As a general rule, the closest preceding and most specific element provides this information: For example, a keySig in the preceding measure is more relevant than a staffDef at the beginning of the section, which is more relevant than a scoreDef at the beginning of the score. However, a section-specific scoreDef that provides only information about the meter does not override the more specific information about key signature gathered from a staffDef for a transposing instrument. Every staffDef may contain a number of layerDef elements, which may be used to establish default values for the distinct layers sharing one staff. MEI does not use the term ‘voice’ to describe these ‘musical threads’ because that term implies continuity across measure boundaries. Given the sometimes arbitrary relationships between these threads from measure to measure as well as across staves, MEI uses the more neutral term ‘layer’.",

  "title": "Redefinition of Score Parameters",

For example. a score may change keys, gain or lose staves, use different layout settings at any point, etc. Likewise, a staff may change its clef, gain or lose layers, or become invisible, and so on. To accommodate these circumstances, in CMN staffDef is allowed to occur in the following locations: within the description of staff groups; that is, in staffGrp, within the content of a measure, between measures; that is, directly within section and ending elements, and between sections and endings; that is, directly within a score or part element. In addition, scoreDef is allowed to occur: within sections and endings; that is, inside section and ending elements; and between sections and endings; that is, directly within a score or part. The possibility also exists to include scoreDef and staffDef in staves and layers when the mei-all schema is in use; however, this practice is not recommended for the CMN repertoire.",

Only information from @pname, @oct and @dur attributes can be gathered in this fashion. No other attributes can be treated this way. The usual CMN-specific values for @dur are: 1: whole note 2: half note 4: quarter note 8: eighth note 16: sixteenth note …: 2048: 2048th note Additionally, the following two values borrowed from mensural notation are allowed, as they sometimes also appear in CMN: breve: double whole long: quadruple whole Please note that their mensural counterparts bear different names in order to clearly distinguish between repertoires. Dotted durational values are accommodated by the @dots attribute, which records the number of written augmentation dots.

  "title": "Grace Notes",
  "text": "The CMN module adds two optional attributes, @grace and @grace.time, to note and chord. The presence of the @grace attribute indicates a grace note.

Therefore, the @dur attribute records only the written rhythmic value of the grace note. The time necessary for the performance of grace notes can be unspecified, calculated based on taking time from other non-grace notes, or specified precisely using the @dur.ges attribute. The values of @grace indicate from which note time is ‘borrowed’ to perform the grace note: The preceding note, in which case the value ‘unacc’ (unaccented) is used, or the following note, when the value ‘acc’ (accented) is appropriate. Technically, this value determines if the note following the grace will keep its original onset time or will be slightly delayed to allow the grace note itself to be accented. Sometimes it is not clear how to perform a grace; in these situations the value ‘unknown’ allows one to indicate a grace note while unambiguously stating that its performed duration remains unknown. The @grace.time attribute is only to be used in combination with the @grace attribute. It records the amount of time (as a percentage of the written duration) that the grace note should ‘steal’ from the preceding note (when @grace=’unacc’) or the following note (when @grace=’acc’).

  "text": "The @stem.mod attribute accommodates various stem modifiers found in the CMN repertoire. These symbols are placed on a note or chord’s stem and generally indicate different types of tremolo and Sprechstimme. The following values are allowed: 1slash: 1 slash through stem 2slash: 2 slashes through stem 3slash: 3 slashes through stem 4slash: 4 slashes through stem 5slash: 5 slashes through stem 6slash: 6 slashes through stem sprech: X placed on stem z: Z placed on stem The @stem.mod attibute is normally used in accordance with practices described in section Tremolandi. The CMN module makes the att.stems.cmn attribute class available, which adds the optional @stem.with attribute to note and chord. The attribute @stem.with allows for the indication of a stem that joins notes on adjacent staves. Cross-staff chord The following code demonstrates one method of encoding the first chord in the last measure in the image above. The @stem.with attribute must occur on all the notes or chords attached to the cross-staff stem. &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" stem.with=\"below\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"2\" stem.with=\"above\"&gt; &lt;note accid=\"n\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; Alternatively, the encoder may choose to treat the notes in the lower staff as logically belonging to the top staff and to ‘displace’ them using the @staff attribute on note. Some use cases, however, may require filling the time that those notes would normally occupy using the space element described in section Event Spacing. Using this mechanism, the example above could also be encoded like so: &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"2\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"n\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" staff=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" staff=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;!-- following content --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- the time used by the notes on staff 2 filled with non-sounding \"space\" --&gt; &lt;space dur=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/space&gt; &lt;!-- following content --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; The choice between these two methods of representing material that crosses staves is often software-dependent.",

  "title": "Timestamps and Durations",
  "text": "MEI offers multiple ways of defining onsets and offsets of timed musical events such as notes and slurs. The most common and most musician-friendly approach to this is through the use of a combination of the attributes @tstamp and @dur, which are made available by the attribute classes att.timestamp.musical (inherited by att.controlevent) and att.duration.musical, both from the shared module. The timestamp (@tstamp) of a musical event is calculated in relation to the meter of the current measure and resembles the so-called ‘beat’. In a common time measure with four quarter notes, the timestamp of each quarter equals its beat position in the measure: The first quarter has a timestamp of 1, the second has a timestamp of 2, and so on. MEI defines the value of @tstamp as a real number; the second eighth note position in a measure would thus be represented by the value of “1.5”. The range of possible values is defined as starting with zero and ending with the number of metrical units in a measure (the ‘numerator’ in a time signature) + 1. This allows the capture of all graphical positions starting from the left barline (‘0’) and ending with the right barline of the measure (‘5’, in the case of 4/4 time). For expressing durations, MEI offers the @dur attribute. This attribute is described in section Basic Usage of Notes in CMN. For ‘spanning’ elements like slurs, which are members of the model.controleventLike class, it is often more intuitive to record two timestamps – one for the onset of the event and one for its termination. Because the termination of the event may be in a succeeding measure, the second timestamp (@tstamp2) has a slightly different datatype than the one marking the initiation of the event. Its datatype is constrained to values following the formula “xm+y”, where x is the number of full measures that this particular feature lasts (or the number of bar lines crossed) and y is the timestamp in the target measure where the feature ends. The timestamp is expressed using the same logic as described above. For example, a value of “0m+3” in 4/4 time indicates that the element bearing this attribute, a slur for example, ends on beat 3 of the same measure where it started. A value of “1m+1.5” would indicate an end on the second eighth note of the following measure. In 6/8 time, the value “2m+3” means that the feature ends two measures later on the third eighth note.",

  "title": "Beams",
  "text": "A very common feature of music from the CMN repertoire is the beaming of eighth or shorter notes. MEI provides two elements for the explicit encoding of features joined by beams. beam A container for a series of explicitly beamed events that begins and ends entirely within a measure. beamSpan (beam span) – Alternative element for explicitly encoding beams, particularly those which extend across bar lines. Use of the beam element is straightforward. The beamed notes, rests, or chords are simply enclosed by the beam element: &lt;layer&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; Whereas in music notation every note value shorter than an eighth adds another beam (sometimes referred to as ‘secondary beams’), in MEI only one beam element is used, no matter the durations of the contained notes. The visual rendition of a set of beamed notes is presumed to be handled by rendering processes. &lt;layer&gt; &lt;!--...--&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"16\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;!-- ...--&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; From the 19th century onwards, it became quite common to break secondary beams to increase readability of longer beamed passages. The optional @breaksec attribute on notes and chords under the beam may be used to encode the breaking of secondary beams after the note or chord bearing the attribute. The value of @breaksec indicates the number of continuous beams. For example: Primary and secondary beams &lt;layer&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"16\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note breaksec=\"1\" dur=\"16\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; In the music of the second half of the 20th century, it is quite common to indicate acceleration or deceleration using converging beams as in the image below: The encoding of such a beam is accomplished using the @rend attribute of the beam, which allows the following values: acc: The secondary beams start in their usual position and gradually converge until they meet with the primary beam on the last note (or, the first eighth note under the beam). rit: The secondary beams gradually diverge until they reach their regular distance. mixed: The secondary beams diverge and converge arbitrarily. norm: The beam is rendered as usual (default). &lt;layer&gt; &lt;!-- … --&gt; &lt;beam rend=\"acc\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;!-- … --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; The duration of notes, rests, or chords under a beam which carries the @rend attribute with a value of ‘acc’, ‘rit’, or ‘mixed’ must be treated specially. The first and last contained elements must specify a duration which matches the number of beams displayed at the point of these events. In the case of a ‘mixed’ beam, each event at the point of change in the number of secondary beams must carry a @dur attribute. Beams like this may be encoded thusly: Accelerando beams &lt;layer&gt; &lt;!-- … --&gt; &lt;beam rend=\"mixed\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;beam rend=\"mixed\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;!-- … --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; Cross-staff beam Beams that connect events on different staves may be encoded in two different ways. First, a single-layer approach may be taken that treats the events lying under the beam as logically belonging to the same layer as the initial event but visually ‘displaced’ to an adjacent staff. In the example below, the last two notes under the beam carry a @staff attribute value that contradicts the ‘normal’ staff placement indicated by the @n attribute on their ancestor staff. &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" staff=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" staff=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; Alternatively, a staff-by-staff methodology may be employed in which the notes are encoded according to the staff on which they appear. This encoding style requires that each beam element account for the total time encompassed by the beam; that is, each beam must use one or more space elements to account for the time occupied by notes on the opposing staff. For example, the time used by the first two notes of the beam must be represented on staff number 1 and the time taken by the last two notes of the beam must be filled on staff number 2. &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;beam beam.with=\"below\"&gt; &lt;space dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/space&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;beam beam.with=\"above\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;space dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/space&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Downstream processing needs are the determining factor in the choice between the two alternative encoding methods. Due to the potential problem of overlapping hierarchies, the beam element only allows the encoding of beams that do not cross barlines. When beams cross barlines, the use of the beamSpan element is required. Unlike beam, the beamSpanelement does not contain the beamed notes as its children. Instead, it references the @xml:id values of all affected notes in its @plist attribute and denotes the initial and terminal notes of the beam using @startid and @endid attributes. This configuration allows beams to cross measure boundaries. The following example demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing beams: &lt;beamSpan endid=\"#note4\" plist=\"#note1 #note2 #note3 #note4\" startid=\"#note1\"&gt;&lt;/beamSpan&gt; In addition to the explicit encoding of beams accommodated by the beam and beamSpan elements and the @beam attribute, MEI allows for specification of default beaming behavior using the following attributes on scoreDef, staffDef, and layerDef: beam.group: Provides an example of how automated beaming (including secondary beams) is to be performed. beam.rests: Indicates whether automatically-drawn beams should include rests shorter than a quarter note duration. The @beam.group attribute can be used to set a default beaming pattern to be used when no beaming is indicated at the layer level. It must contain a comma-separated list of time values that add up to a measure in the current meter, e.g., ‘4,4,4,4’ in 4/4 time indicates that each quarter note worth of shorter notes should be beamed together. Parentheses can be used to indicate sub-groupings of secondary beams. For example, ‘(4.,4.,4.)’ in 9/8 meter indicates one primary beam per measure with secondary beams broken at each dotted quarter duration, while ‘(4,4),(4,4)’ in 4/4 will result in a measure of 16th notes being rendered with a primary beam covering all the notes and secondary beams for each group of four 16th notes. The @beam.group attribute is available on scoreDef, staffDef, and layerDef elements, making it possible to set different beaming patterns for each of these. Also, the beaming pattern can be changed anywhere score parameters may be changed, for example, at the start of sections. This beaming “directive” can be overridden by using beam, beamSpan, or @beam attributes as described above. If none of these beaming specifications is used, then no beaming is implied. Default beaming can be explicitly ‘turned off’ by setting @beam.group to an empty string.",

  "title": "Ties, Slurs and Phrase Marks",
  "text": "One of the most specific features of CMN is the use of ‘curved lines’ which connect notes. These lines are used to indicate various musical features, depending on their context. A tie is a curved line connecting two notes of the same pitch. The purpose of a tie is to join the durations of both notes, so that the first note sounds for the combined duration. In other words, there is only one onset for both notes. In MEI, ties can be encoded in different ways, depending on the level of detail that the encoder wants to preserve. The simplest solution is to use the @tie attribute found on note and chord. &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; This attribute allows three values: i (initial): Marks the start of a tie m (medial): Marks a participant in a tie other than the first or last t (terminal): Marks the end of a tie The scope of the @tie attribute is the musical layer; that is, a tie started in one layer may only be ended by a subsequent musical event with a @tie attribute with an m or t value in the same layer. The tie-terminating event may lie in the following measure. Ties across barlines &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- staff 1 omitted --&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"16\"&gt;&lt;/chord&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"4\"&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\" tie=\"m\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\" tie=\"m\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" tie=\"m\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;!-- staff 1 omitted --&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"16\"&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;!-- measures 3 and 4 omitted --&gt; When @tie is used on chords, it functions as a shorthand indication for multiple tie markings; that is, a separate tie is drawn for every pitch in the chord that remains unchanged in the succeeding chord. &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"4\" tie=\"i\"&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"4\" tie=\"t\"&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; This is equivalent to the following, more verbose version: &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"4\"&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"4\"&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; A slur is a curved line that connects a group of notes of different pitch. It normally indicates that an instrument-specific performance technique should be applied to the affected notes. For example, in notation for winds, the notes should be played in one breath, while a single bow is indicated for string instruments. Slurs In MEI, slurs may be encoded in a similar way to ties: note and chord bear a @slur attribute that allows the commencement or ending of a slur at this element. The allowed values, however, are slightly different: The i, m or t are followed by a single digit in the range 1 to 6, as in the following example: &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"i1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"t1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; The reason for this difference is that slurs, unlike ties, may overlap, so that a second slur may start while the first slur is still ongoing. The digit indicates the level of nesting of slurs on the note; ‘1’ indicates no nesting, while ‘2’ indicates the existence of 2 slurs in which this note participates, and so on. In the example below, the second and third quarter notes lie under 2 slurs. The second note is covered by the slur that begins on the preceding note and by the one that it starts. The third note is affected by the slur that begins on note one and by the one that starts on note two. &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"i2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"t2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"t1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" slur=\"i1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; To support analytical operations, @slur may take on more than one value. For example, the example above may be more explicitly encoded as: &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"m1 i2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1 t2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"t1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" slur=\"i1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; In this encoding, the notes in the beamed group are marked as participating in two slurs – one connecting just the beamed notes and one connecting the first and last notes of the layer. In ‘nested’ slurs like this, the function of the slurs is usually different. Here, the slur connecting the 8th notes indicates legato performance, while the longer slur functions as a phrase mark. While ties are not normally allowed to cross layers or staves, slurs may. The following example demonstrates how cross-staff slurs may be encoded using the @slur attribute: &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"m1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"m1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Slurs and ties that cross system or page breaks are often split into two separate symbols for rendering. One slur or tie ends at the last barline, another one starts at the beginning of the new system. MEI expects this to be the default rendering behaviour, so that in situations like these, the regular @tie or @slur attributes are sufficient to describe both curved lines resulting from the split. Sometimes, however, one of these two symbols is missing in the document, or the encoder wants to provide additional (often visual) information about the slur or tie. In these cases, using an attribute is not an adequate solution. Therefore, MEI offers dedicated tie and slur elements. A third element, phrase, is used to identify a unified melodic idea (in German: Phrasierungsbogen), whereas the slur element is used as a generic element for all curved lines (in German: Bogensetzung) except ties. All three elements have nearly identical models. Another reason for using elements instead of attributes for ties, slurs, and phrase marks is that only elements may be combined with the functionality provided in chapters Editorial Markup and Critical Apparatus of these Guidelines. Although these elements are allowed within a layer to accommodate unmeasured notation, by convention in CMN they are normally placed inside measure, after the encoding of staves, alongside other so-called ‘control events’. &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;slur&gt;&lt;/slur&gt; &lt;tempo&gt;&lt;/tempo&gt; &lt;dynam&gt;&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Obviously, to be complete the slur in the above example needs to be ‘attached’ to the notes somehow. The ‘vertical assignment’ can be indicated for the example above using the @staff and @layer attributes like so: &lt;slur layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/slur&gt; For the ‘horizontal assignment’, the encoder may choose between two different mechanisms. The first uses two timestamp attributes as described in section Timestamps and Durations. The start and end points of the slur may be indicated thusly: &lt;slur layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"&gt;&lt;/slur&gt; By using @tstamp and @tstamp2 attributes, the encoder denotes a rather loose connection – the slur (or tie) is attached to a certain position in the measure, not to a specific note or chord. If the encoder wants to specify a close connection to a particular event, the @startid and @endid attributes may be used instead. Here, the @xml:ids of the first and last note of the slur are referenced. This mechanism also allows the crossing of layers and staves. For human readability, it is recommended to encode slur, tie and phrase features in the measure where they begin; that is, in the measure that holds the element referenced by @startid. On the other hand, for machine processability, it may be desirable to place slur, tie, and phrase elements in the measure where they end or even in the last measure regardless of their beginning and ending points in the music. This last option makes all references contained within these elements ‘back references’. Back references are necessary when using processing software that treats the encoded file as a stream; that is, programs that process the file without creating an in-memory representation of its contents. When using the tie, slur or phrase elements, the curvature of the line may be described using the @curvedir, @bulge and @bezier attributes. Whereas the first attribute allows only specification of the slur’s vertical placement, the others give increasingly more precise control of the curve. If the encoder wishes to draw attention to the appearance of a slur or tie in a given source, the @facs attribute may be used instead of (or in addition to) the curve description attributes to point to a graphic image or a zone within an image (see Facsimiles).",

  "title": "Dynamics in CMN",
  "text": "Common Music Notation provides two different methodologies for expressing the volume of a note, phrase, section, etc. The first is a verbal instruction providing such information in human language, possibly in an abbreviated form. An example is the word piano, indicating a quiet volume, often abbreviated as p. In MEI, verbal instructions like this are encoded using the dynam element from the Shared module (see chapter Shared Elements, Models, and Attributes): &lt;dynam&gt;p&lt;/dynam&gt; By convention, dynam elements, like slur and other elements belonging to the model.controleventLike class, are encoded at the end of the measure to which they belong. This requires dynam to be assigned to a certain staff using the @staff attribute, whose value refers to the target element’s @n attribute. In the absence of other information, all layers within the staff are assumed to have the same dynamic marking. &lt;dynam staff=\"1\"&gt;p&lt;/dynam&gt; However, when the layers of a staff have different dynamic indications, the @layer attribute may be used to associate a dynamic marking with a particular layer: &lt;dynam layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"&gt;p&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;dynam layer=\"2\" staff=\"1\"&gt;mf&lt;/dynam&gt; A value in the range 0-127 may be assigned to a dynamic marking using the @val attribute: &lt;dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\" val=\"84\"&gt;f&lt;/dynam&gt; The location of a dynamic marking in relation to a staff may be specified using the @place attribute, which may be given as above, within, or below the staff: &lt;dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"1\"&gt;p&lt;/dynam&gt; Dynamics must also be associated with a particular time point in a measure, using the @tstamp, or with a particular event, using the @startid attribute. Linking a control event with measures and events is discussed in section Timestamps and Durations: &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;p&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Dynamics which do not have an explicit endpoint are often referred to as ‘instantaneous’. On the other hand, some dynamic directions indicate a continuous change that must have a defined end point. It is possible to specify the logical scope of continuous dynamic marks using the attributes @tstamp2, @dur or @endid. In order to capture the fact that they continue until the first beat of the next measure, the crescendi in the example above may be marked: &lt;!-- using the tstamp2 attribute --&gt;&lt;dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;!-- using the endid attribute --&gt; &lt;dynam endid=\"ID_of_ending_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; Any combination of @tstamp, @startid, @tstamp2, and @endid attributes may be used to define the scope of a dynamic, although the @tstamp and @tstamp2 or the @startid and @endid combinations are the most likely combinations. For example, the following alternatives are all possibilities for encoding up a crescendo. The choice of attributes is often task or processor dependent. &lt;!-- tstamp attribute indicates starting point, dur attribute marks the end --&gt;&lt;dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;!-- tstamp attribute indicates starting point, endid attribute marks the end --&gt; &lt;dynam endid=\"ID of last note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;!-- startid attribute indicates starting point, tstamp2 attribute marks the end --&gt; &lt;dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"ID_of_starting_note\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; &lt;!-- startid attribute indicates starting point, endid attribute marks the end --&gt; &lt;dynam endid=\"ID_of_ending_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"ID_of_starting_note\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; All musical elements affected by the dynam may be explicitly specified using the @plist attribute, which contains @xml:id attribute value references: &lt;dynam endid=\"#note4\" place=\"above\" plist=\"#note1 #note2 #note3 #note4\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"#note1\"&gt;cresc. poco a poco&lt;/dynam&gt; It is recommended that the list of references in @plist include all participants in the dynamic marking, including the first and last notes as in the preceding example, even though they are duplicated by @startid and @endid attributes. In addition to verbal instructions, Common Music Notation uses graphical symbols to indicate ‘continuous’ dynamics. These crescendo and decrescendo (or diminuendo) symbols are encoded in MEI using the hairpin element. It also is a member of the model.controleventLike class, which means it too is used just before the close of a measure element, following the encoding of all staves. The required attribute @form specifies the direction of the symbol by taking one of two possible values: cres (growing louder) or dim (getting softer). &lt;hairpin form=\"cres\"&gt;&lt;/hairpin&gt; Marking the logical extent of hairpins is possible using the same attributes as for dynam. The following example shows a hairpin that begins on the second half of beat 2 (in the current measure) and ends on beat 1 (of the following measure). &lt;hairpin form=\"cres\" layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"&gt;&lt;/hairpin&gt;",

  "title": "Tuplets",
  "text": "Tuplets indicate a localized change of meter; that is, a given duration in the regular meter is divided between a group of notes with irregular (according to the current meter) rhythmic values. The most common tuplet is a so-called ‘triplet’, in which three notes take the time normally occupied by two. The relation of the tuplet to the underlying meter is specified using the @num and @numbase attributes, where @num specifies the number of replacing notes and @numbase specifies the number of notes of the same duration to be replaced. For example, when three eighth notes replace one quarter note in common time, @num takes a value of “3”, whereas @numbase reads “2”, because a quarter note in common time is normally divided into two eighths. When three quarters replace two in the same meter, @numbase also reads “2”. The combination of these attributes may be read as “3 in the time of 2” in either case. The duration of the entire tuplet may be encoded using the usual ‘power of 2’ values, e.g., 1, 2, 4, etc., in the @dur attribute, and the @dots attribute, if necessary. &lt;layer&gt; &lt;tuplet dur=\"2\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; Tuplets are often highlighted using brackets above or below the affected notes. The presence and position of these brackets can be encoded using the @bracket.place (above / below) and @bracket.visible (true / false) attributes. Usually, however, tuplets are rendered with a bracket (@bracket.visible=”true”) and a single number (@num.format=”count” and @num.visible=”true”). However, the number-to-numbase ratio may be provided in addition to, or in some cases as a replacement for, the bracket. The @num.format attribute indicates whether a plain number (the value of @num) or a ratio (comprised of @num and @numbase, e.g., “3:2”) should be displayed and @num.visible indicates the general presence of such a number. In addition to note elements, tuplet may contain other elements, such as rest or space, to match the content of a source document or an intended rendering. In particular, the beam element is allowed so that custom beaming may be indicated, e.g., a septuplet may be divided into a group of three plus a group of four notes. The tuplet element may also be used for repetition of the same pitch; that is, a single note or chord may be the only content of the tuplet. In some cases, optical music recognition software may treat these instances as bowed tremolandi due to the knowledge of the complete semantics of the notation at the time of recognition. However, marking these as tuplets is the recommended practice. In some situations, a tuplet is made up of events in different measures. As this raises the issue of non-concurrent hierarchies, it is not possible to encode such situations with the tuplet element described above. Therefore, MEI offers the tupletSpan element, which is member of the model.controleventLike class. It is nested inside of measure, following all the measure’s staff children. It uses the same attributes as tuplet to describe tuplets, but instead of nesting all affected notes inside itself, it references the @xml:id values of all affected notes in its @plist attribute and the initial and terminal notes of the tuplet using @startid and @endid attributes. This configuration allows tuplets to cross measure boundaries. The following example demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing tuplets: &lt;tupletSpan endid=\"#note4\" plist=\"#note1 #note2 #note3 #note4\" startid=\"#note1\"&gt;&lt;/tupletSpan&gt;",

  "title": "Arpeggio and Glissando",
  "text": "In CMN, the notes of a chord are sometimes performed successively rather than simultaneously. This behavior, called arpeggiation, is normally indicated using a wavy line preceding the chord. MEI offers the arpeg element to describe arpeggios. This element is a member of the model.controleventLike class and, like other members of this class, uses the @staff, @layer and @tstamp or the @startid and @endid attributes to connect it to the affected chord. &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"4\"&gt; &lt;!-- notes omitted --&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;note&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;arpeg staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"&gt;&lt;/arpeg&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The usual direction for the performance of an arpeggio is from lowest note to highest, but this is not always the case. The customary signal of an downward arpeggio is an arrowhead added to the bottom of the wavy line. The indication of the presence of an arrowhead and the direction of the arpeggio are handled separately, however. The @arrow attribute indicates the presence of an arrowhead in the arpeggiation sign, while the @order attribute records the preferred sequence of notes. The following example illustrates various ways in which the arrow and order attributes may be employed. The default visual rendition and performance are assumed in the absence of both attributes, while the typical downward arpeggio is indicated by the presence of both attributes. The last two possibilities occur less frequently, but are sometimes appropriate: The presence of the arrow attribute without the order attribute may be used in those cases where the arrowhead is redundant but is added to the symbol for the sake of consistency or when the direction of successive arpeggios changes frequently. The last possibility, an order attribute without an arrow attribute, is ambiguous; however, it can be used as an encoding shortcut since a downward arpeggio must have a visual indication of its direction to distinguish it from the upward arpeggio; therefore, the presence of the arrowhead can be implied. &lt;!-- default visualization and performance --&gt;&lt;arpeg staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"&gt;&lt;/arpeg&gt; &lt;!-- downward arpeggio with arrow added to visual symbol --&gt; &lt;arpeg arrow=\"true\" order=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"&gt;&lt;/arpeg&gt; &lt;!-- default rendition with (redundant) arrow added to the top of the visual symbol --&gt; &lt;arpeg arrow=\"true\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"&gt;&lt;/arpeg&gt; &lt;!-- downward arpeggio with no visual indication of order --&gt; &lt;arpeg order=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"&gt;&lt;/arpeg&gt; A third, and somewhat counter-intuitive, value for @order, “nonarp”, indicates that no arpeggio shall be performed. Normally rendered as a bracket instead of a wavy line, this form of arpeggio is used to indicate a non-arpeggiated chord intervening in a sequence of arpeggiated ones. This is common in music for the harp, where arpeggiation is the usual method of performing chords and deviation from the norm must be explicitly indicated. For arpeggios that involve chords spanning multiple staves as a continuous arpeggio (instead of two separate arpeggios), the @plist attribute may be used to point to all affected chord elements’ @xml:id attributes. Whereas an arpeggio ‘staggers’ the onset times of the notes of a chord, a glissando denotes a situation where the pitch ‘slides’ from one note to another. It makes no difference whether this slide produces distinct intermediate pitches (as on the piano) or not (as on the trombone), though the latter is sometimes referred to as portamento. The visual appearance of a glissando, which MEI encodes as gliss, is normally a line connecting the two most distant notes in the glissando. The gliss element is a member of the model.controleventLike class and therefore, like other control events, it occurs inside a measure after the staves and uses its @staff, @layer, @tstamp, @tstamp2, @startid and @endid attributes to connect it to the affected notes or chords. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute. The visual appearance of the indicating line may be recorded in the @rend attribute.

  "title": "Tremolandi",
  "text": "CMN has two slightly different concepts which are both called tremolo. The first is a rapid repetition of a single pitch or chord, whereas the second is a rapid alternation between two different notes or chords. In addition, either species of tremolo may be measured or unmeasured. A measured tremolo is an abbreviation for written-out notation; that is, the tremolo is intended to be perceived as notes with distinct rhythmic values. On the other hand, in an unmeasured tremolo no specific number of alternations is intended. For the repetition of a single note or chord, MEI offers the bTrem (bowed tremolo) element, which is a member of the model.eventLike class, meaning it is encoded following the normal course of musical events within a layer. It holds exactly one note or chord element that is to be repeated. Bowed tremolandi &lt;bTrem&gt; &lt;note dur=\"1\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/bTrem&gt; The @measperf attribute value indicates the exact note values in an aural rendition of a measured tremolo, i.e., quarters, 8ths, and so on. The stem modifier must also be explicity set on the child note or chord element for a complete visual representation. The number of slashes present on the note may disagree with the number of slashes that should be present according to the @measperf attribute, especially in music manuscripts. &lt;bTrem measperf=\"32\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"3slash\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/bTrem&gt; The bTrem element can be used as shorthand for a tuplet consisting of repetitions of a single note or chord. This kind of markup may be the result of an optical music recognition process in which complete semantics cannot be determined a priori. When used this way, the @num attribute on bTrem can record a number to be rendered along with the pseudo-tuplet. In spite of this capability, the tuplet element is preferred. &lt;bTrem num=\"3\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"3slash\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/bTrem&gt; In the case of alternating pitches, MEI offers the fTrem (fingered tremolo) element. While it mostly behaves the same as bTrem, a fingered tremolo requires exactly two child elements, either being a note or chord. The @measperf attribute value indicates the exact note values in an aural rendition of a measured tremolo, i.e., 4ths, 8ths, 16ths, etc. The number of slashes present in the source is captured by the @slash attribute. The number of slashes present may disagree with the rhythmic value indicated by the @measperf attribute, especially in manuscript sources. &lt;fTrem measperf=\"32\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/fTrem&gt;",

A fermata indicates that the note or rest under it should be held longer than its written duration would normally require. Sometimes, a fermata occurs over a barline to indicate the end of a phrase or section. In MEI, fermatas may be encoded using an attribute on note, chord or rest.

  "text": "The term ossia, Italian for “or”, denotes an alternative for a certain passage which is provided by the composer without any preference of one alternative over another. An ossia often provides a simpler (easier to perform) version of the original content. Another frequent use case for ossia is the provision of indications about performance practice, such as an alternative version with ornamentation written out in full. In all cases, it is up to the performer to choose between the alternatives. Most often an ossia is rendered above the main staff on a reduced-size staff. Sometimes, however, the alternate material occurs on the same staff as the primary text, but in a separate layer. In this case, the alternative material is usually rendered in small-sized notation on the normal-sized staff. For both situations, MEI offers the ossia element, which may be nested either inside measure to reflect an ossia on a separate staff, or inside staff to reflect an inline ossia in a separate layer. The following example demonstrates an ossia on a separate staff: &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- first staff, without ossia --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;ossia&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;!-- alternative content on reduced-size staff --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;!-- original content on regular staff --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/ossia&gt; &lt;staff n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;!-- third staff, without ossia --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The example above demonstrates that only one of the two staff elements within ossia has an @n attribute. This mechanism allows one to distinguish between the “regular” and the “alternative” content: The one bearing the @n attribute goes in line with the preceding measure’s staff, the other one is printed in reduced size above. In this case, the vertical order of staves follows document order: The top-most staff is encoded as the first child, the lowest comes last. In combination with the presence of the @n attribute, this allows the capture of multiple simultaneous ossia staves. All staves within ossia, even the alternative ones without a direct reference, obey the definitions of the associated staffDef, which can be derived from the value of the @n attribute. Alternatively, a separate staffDef may be given at the beginning of the contained layer element(s). In case of an inline ossia, the whole setup of elements moves down one step in the hierarchy, as seen in the following example: &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;ossia&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- original content in regular layer --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;!-- alternative content in separate layer --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/ossia&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt;",

Though it is possible to label the movement, etc. using a @label attribute attached to the enclosing structural entity (that is, on mdiv or section), it is often required to capture the exact position, spelling, or other features of the label as found in the underlying source material. In these cases, an element is necessary. Labels which address the tempo at which the music should be performed should be encoded using the tempo element, which is a specialized form of dir. tempo is a member of the model.controleventLike class and as such occurs as a child of measure, following all staff children. Its @staff, @layer and @tstamp attributes are used to ensure correct semantic positioning, and @place indicates a visual position with respect to the staff. &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- all staves omitted --&gt; &lt;tempo place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;Allegro moderato&lt;/tempo&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Rehearsal marks are another specialized kind of directive. Consisting of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, rehearsal marks are used in scores and corresponding performer parts to identify convenient points to restart rehearsal after breaks or interruptions. For this reason, they are often visually emphasized by placing them within a square or circle. In MEI, they are encoded using the reh element, which holds the textual content of the rehearsal mark. The visual rendition of the rehearsal mark, including the surrounding shape, may be captured using the rend element described in chapter Text Rendition. The following detail from an edition of Hector Berlioz’ Symphonie Fantastique shows a typical example: Rehearsal mark &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;!-- content omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;reh place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt; &lt;rend rend=\"box\"&gt;37&lt;/rend&gt; &lt;/reh&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The following example demonstrates how rehearsal marks often apply to more than one staff. In this instance, the rehearsal mark is placed above staff 1 and below staves 7 and 11. &lt;measure&gt; &lt;reh place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;A&lt;/reh&gt; &lt;reh place=\"below\" staff=\"7 11\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;A&lt;/reh&gt; &lt;/measure&gt;",

Repetition in this sense can be thought of as ‘structural’. At the same time, composers and engravers of music often use local symbols for repeating smaller portions of music instead of writing them in full more than once. In this case, the repetition is better defined as a species of abbreviation.",

  "title": "Measure-Level Repetition Symbols",
  "text": "In addition to repetition at the section level, CMN includes a number of different symbols for measure-level repetitions. Many of these symbols are found in manuscripts and may be regarded as personal conventions of their respective authors. Some signs, however, have been widely adopted. For example, it is common to indicate the repetition of a single beat or an entire measure with one or more diagonal lines, sometimes with dots at the upper left and lower right, much like a percent sign. The illustration below contains the most common signs: Beat repeat signs In general, MEI places primary emphasis on the capture of the semantic meaning of symbols, not their visual rendition. In this case, the focus is on the material being repeated, for example, a beat, a measure, a 2-measure fragment, etc. The following elements are provided for this purpose: beatRpt (beat repeat) – An indication that material on a preceding beat should be repeated. halfmRpt (half-measure repeat) – A half-measure repeat in any meter. mRpt (measure repeat) – An indication that the previous measure should be repeated. mRpt2 (2-measure repeat) – An indication that the previous two measures should be repeated. multiRpt (multiple repeat) – Multiple repeated measures. The beatRpt element is used to represent a single repeated beat. Its visual rendition can be recorded using the @rend attribute. This attribute indicates the number of slashes required to render the appropriate repeat symbol, which, as demonstrated in the preceding figure, depends on the rhythmic content of the beat being repeated. When a beat that consists of a single note or chord is repeated, the repetition sign is typically rendered as a single thick, slanting slash; therefore, the value ‘1’ should be used. The following values should be used when the beat is divided into even notes: 4ths or 8ths=1, 16ths=2, 32nds=3, 64ths=4, 128ths=5. When the beat is comprised of mixed duration values, the symbol is always rendered as 2 slashes and 2 dots. In addition to its indication of a repeated beat, the beatRpt element is sometimes used in popular music notation, especially in guitar or percussion parts, to indicate a repeated rhythmic pattern. The beatRpt element can be used, but when these parts require durations longer or shorter than a beat, note elements with appropriately-shaped note heads should be employed instead. The mRpt element is available for repetition of an entire measure. Like mRest, it must be the sole child of layer, no other events should be used. The @n attribute of mRpt should not be used to record the number displayed above the measure in the figure below. Instead, the numbering of repetitions of the written-out measure can be enabled using the @multi.number attribute available on the scoreDef and staffDef elements. Measure repetition &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"16\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;mRpt&gt;&lt;/mRpt&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;mRpt&gt;&lt;/mRpt&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;mRpt&gt;&lt;/mRpt&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The halfmRpt element represents the incorrect, but frequently found, use of the measure repeat (or similar) sign to indicate repetition of half of a measure. This practice mostly occurs in hand-written notation and usually involves the repetition of the second half of a measure in duple time. This element is necessary because the function of the symbol, not the visual symbol itself, is of primary importance. The following example from the beginning of Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata illustrates such usage: Half-measure repeat &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- omitted --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"2\" stem.mod=\"1slash\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"2\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"1\" pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;halfmRpt&gt;&lt;/halfmRpt&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;!-- omitted --&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;halfmRpt&gt;&lt;/halfmRpt&gt; &lt;halfmRpt&gt;&lt;/halfmRpt&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; As seen in the example above, it is possible to continuously repeat half measures, even across barlines. The mRpt2 and multiRpt elements (like the multiRest element) never occur in scores, only in performer parts, where it is often necessary to abbreviate the notation due to page size limitations. Two-measure repetition Multi-measure repetition The mRpt2 element represents repetition of a 2-measure fragment, while multiRpt is for repetition of fragments longer than two measures. In modern publishing practice, repeats of more than two measures are written out using repeat signs. This element is provided, however, for handling non-standard practices often found in manuscripts. The @num attribute on multiRpt records the number of preceding measures to be repeated. All elements described above allow for association of the sign with a symbol in a digital facsimile (via the @facs attribute) and with a user-defined symbol (using @altsym). See Facsimiles and User-defined Symbols for further details. In addition, the @expand attribute is available on the foregoing elements to inform a rendering process whether to use the repeat symbol or the full content represented by it. A value of “true” indicates that the content should be displayed, while a “false” value means to show only the repeat symbol.",

  "title": "Mensural Notation",
  "text": "This chapter describes the module for encoding mensural notation from the late 13th century to about 1600. Historically, mensural notation preceded the development of Common Music Notation (CMN) and it included a wide range of features that persist in CMN and that can be encoded in a standard manner in MEI. In mensural notation, pitches are notated as in CMN, leaving out here the major exception of musica ficta. The pitch is given by the position of the note on the staff and the current clef as in CMN, and the mensural module introduces no modification to MEI regarding how pitches are encoded. There are a certain number of differences, however, regarding the representation of duration in mensural notation. The mensural module introduces specific attribute values for notes and rests for appropriately encoding mensural durations. One of the main particularities is that the actual duration of a note is not given only by its symbol but also by position and the context in which the symbol appears. The general context is given by one of the 16 mensural species provide four levels of division: modus major, modus minor, tempus and prolatio. Depending on the context, certain rules must be applied in order to determine the duration of a note. In these cases, encoding both the sign and its actual duration is highy desirable. Another particularity of mensural notation is the use of proportions that are indicated by numeric proportions or by specific mensuration signs. The proportions indicate that the durations have to be modified accordingly and they can be combined in a very complex manner. Over time, proportions and mensuration signs were simplified and became time signatures in CMN. The attributes and elements that are necessary for encoding proportions and mensural signs are made available by the module. In mensural notation, notes can also be notated in ligatures that regroup two or more notes. Ligatures were a legacy from an earlier notation system that were still widely used in Renaissance music notation. They gradually disappeared during the seventeenth century. The mensural module provides multiple ways of encoding the ligatures.",

  "text": "In ternary divisions, the dichotomy between the duration sign of the notes and their actual duration requires specific attention. The rules of mensural notation can require the alteration or the imperfection of a note; that is, an increase or reduction in its performed duration. In these cases, if the encoding is intended to be suitable for more than just graphically representing the notation, encoding only the duration of the sign can quickly become insufficient. It that case, it is recommended to encode the sign in the @dur attribute and its performed duration using the @num and @numbase attributes. The following example illustrates an alteration (the second brevis) in modus minor perfectus and tempus imperfectum. The performed duration of each note is given as a proportion of a whole note using the @num and @numbase: &lt;note dur=\"longa\" num=\"6\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"brevis\" num=\"2\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"brevis\" num=\"4\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"longa\" num=\"6\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; The following example illustrates an imperfection (the two longae) in modus minor perfectus and tempus perfectum with the same longa-brevis-brevis-longa sequence but with an additional punctus divisionis between the two breves: &lt;note dur=\"longa\" num=\"6\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"brevis\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;dot form=\"div\"&gt;&lt;/dot&gt; &lt;note dur=\"brevis\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"longa\" num=\"6\" numbase=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt;",

  "title": "Neume Notation",
  "text": "Most neume notation is used to set music to an existing text. The syllable is the fundamental unit of structure, with the neumes themselves serving as a means of “sonifying” the text. A syllable may be expressed via one or more neumes, with the particular neume shape chosen depending on the pitch contour that is being employed and the desired interpretation. For example, two pitches in rising succession might be encoded as a “podatus” (sometimes also called a “pes”), or it might be encoded as two separate punctums, depending on whether it should be sung smoothly connected or with a slight amount of space between the notes. There are a limited number of possiblities for the most popular musical contours. In general, groups of two to four notes are given unique names, assigned depending on their contour. A “clivis” would be two joined descending notes, while a “podatus” is two joined ascending notes. Table 1 shows most of the named neume shapes. Neume groups of more than four notes are simply called “compound” neumes. Table 1. Variant neume notation. (From Parrish, \"The notation of medieval music,\" 6) As shown in Table 1, it is possible to have many different styles of neume shapes, derived from local practices of regional groups. In general, these styles are all interpreted in a similar fashion; however, there is evidence that the performance practice of some styles of neume notation differed with regard to rhythm and cadence. This version of the MEI neumes module does not attempt to encode any rhythmic information present in the neume notation. While it may be possible to encode rhythmic values on note elements, this practice is highly discouraged and, if present, should be interpreted as a modern transcription not present in the original sources. Neume notation existed before the invention of the staff. Staffless neume notation (“adiastemtic”, “cheironomic” or “in campo aperto”) existed primarily as a mnemonic device, reminding performers of the contour of the melody but lacking any absolute pitch information. These neumes were written above the text. With the invention of the staff lines and the clef, “heightened” or “diastematic” neume notation could be used to provide exact interval information. In some cases the staff lines are not actually drawn on the page, but their position relative to an imaginary line and initial clef is consistent. The syllable element is used as the primary organizational element for neume notation within a layer element. Within syllable, the syl element defined in the MEI.shared module is used for encoding the textual content, while the uneume and ineume elements are used to encode the neumes themeselves. Within these neume module elements, other standard MEI mechanisms are available to accommodate, for example, editorial or critical markup.",

The analysis module offers several attributes in the att.common.anl class for the description of basic relationships: @copyof Points to an element of which the current element is a copy. @corresp Used to point to other elements that correspond to this one in a generic fashion. @next Used to point to the next event(s) in a user-defined collection. @prev Points to the previous event(s) in a user-defined collection. @sameas Points to an element that is the same as the current element but is not a literal copy of the current element. @synch Points to elements that are synchronous with the current element. The att.alignment class also contains an attribute for describing temporal relationships: @when Indicates the point of occurrence of this feature along a time line. Its value must be the ID of a element elsewhere in the document. These attributes accommodate the encoding of linkages between the element carrying the attribute and one or more other elements.

On the contrary, these attributes can be used to capture information about relations between any elements. Using these attributes makes it possible to create relationships between events, which are often widely-spaced in both encoded order and time. The attributes allow a large number of connections, enhancing the informational content, and therefore the potential usefulness, of the encoding. The @copyof attribute points to an element of which the current element is a copy. It can be used to repeat a note, for example, without encoding the whole note element again. The copy is a ‘deep’one; that is, the @copyof attribute copies all attributes and child elements which belong to the copied element, such as the @dur and @oct attributes of a copied note. The value of the @copyof attribute must be a URI, which usually refers to an element in the current document. The following example demonstrates use of the @copyof attribute: &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.note1_1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note copyof=\"#analysis.note1_1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; In this example. the note in the second measure has exactly the same characteristics as the note in the first measure. Using @copyof is not limited to copying events. The @copyof attribute can also be used to copy an entire measure or staff. When there are many repeated features, the use of the @copyof greatly reduces encoding effort. The image and the following encoding of the beginning of Schubert’s Erlkönig illustrates the benefit of using the @copyof attribute. First measure of Schubert's Erlkönig &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;mRest&gt;&lt;/mRest&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;tuplet num=\"3\" num.visible=\"true\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup1\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"8\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"8\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"8\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup1\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup2\"&gt;&lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup1\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup3\"&gt;&lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup1\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup4\"&gt;&lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;mRest&gt;&lt;/mRest&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; This example can be reduced further by using @copyof inside the initial tuplet to represent the repeated chords: &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;mRest&gt;&lt;/mRest&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;tuplet num=\"3\" num.visible=\"true\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup5\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"8\" xml:id=\"analysis.t1c1\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;chord copyof=\"#analysis.t1c1\"&gt;&lt;/chord&gt; &lt;chord copyof=\"#analysis.t1c1\"&gt;&lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup5\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup6\"&gt;&lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup5\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup7\"&gt;&lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup5\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup8\"&gt;&lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"3\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;mRest&gt;&lt;/mRest&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; While @copyof signifies a duplicate copy of an element, the @sameas indicates that the current element represents exactly the same entity as the one referenced in @sameas. Use of @sameas is used for describing the same entity from multiple perspectives, e.g., the same event in two layers. The following example illustrates the sharing of one note head between two voices in the first full measure of a chorale: Bach Chorale, \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh' darein\", m. 1-2 &lt;measure n=\"1\" xml:id=\"analysis.m_sc_22\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_23_3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_24_3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" sameas=\"analysis.n_sc_25_2\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_25_3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_26_3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_23_2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_24_2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" sameas=\"analysis.n_sc_25_3\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_25_2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_26_2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_27_2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_23_1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_24_1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_25_1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_26_1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_27_1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"n_sc_23_0\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"n_sc_24_0\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"n_sc_25_0\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"n_sc_26_0\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"n_sc_27_0\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; While @copyof and @sameas have defined semantics, the @corresp may be used to create user-defined relationships between elements. The example below demonstrates the encoding of a relationship between #note3 and the fermata, even though the fermata is not placed directly above the note. &lt;measure n=\"1\" right=\"end\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.note1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.note2\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.note3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;fermata corresp=\"#analysis.note3\" place=\"above\" tstamp=\"4.75\"&gt;&lt;/fermata&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The @corresp attribute only marks the correspondence between the current element and one or more other entities. To describe the nature of the correspondence, one must use annot. The @next and @prev attributes point to elements which follow or precede the current element in some fashion other than that indicated by encoding order. The use of these attributes helps to avoid confusion in the sequence of events, for example, in voice leading across layers or staves, when the encoding reflects the physical arrangement of voices. In the second measure of the following example, the target of the next attribute occurs after the pointing element in time, but before it in encoding order: Bach Chorale, \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh' darein\", m. 6-7 &lt;measure n=\"6\" xml:id=\"analysis.m_sc_62\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_63_3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_65_3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt;

The @synch attribute points to an element that is synchronous with; that is, begins at the same moment in time, as the current element. It is useful when the encoding order differs from the order in which entities occur in time. The @when attribute may be used to indicate the point of occurrence of the feature bearing this attribute along a time line. Its value must be the ID of a when element.

First, Parsons Code allows for description of the contour of the melody in very general terms; that is, as up, down, or same note. Parsons Code is helpful for identifying musical works with clearly defined melodies and analyzing the relationship between successive notes of monophonic tunes. For more information about the Parsons Code, please see the “The Directory of Tunes and Musical Themes” by Denys Parsons (2002).

It is only allowed on the note element. The @pclass attribute comes from “musical set theory” elaborated first by Howard Hanson and Allen Forte as a new method for organizing tones. It provides a concept for categorizing musical objects (notes) and describing their relationships. It is a kind of grouping and combining, mostly developed in connection with atonal music. However, the concept of set theory is general and can also be applied to tonal music. A pitch class means the summary of every pitch with specific characteristics that means a pitch class set is an unordered collection of pitches, e.g., every pitch with the name C. A pitch class may contain a large number of pitches, because different octaves and enharmonic spellings of pitch make no difference. The notes C, E, and G would be 0, 4 and 7 in pitch class notation, for example, regardless of the octave in which they are performed. The example below contains the same pitch in four different enharmonic spellings, but all are part of the same pitch class. &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pclass=\"2\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"5\" pclass=\"2\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"ss\" dur=\"4\" pclass=\"2\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note accid=\"ff\" dur=\"1\" pclass=\"2\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; For further information on pitch class set theory, please consult the following sources: http://www.mta.ca/faculty/arts-letters/music/pc-set_project/pc-set_new/pages/introduction/toc.html “Analyzing Atonal Music: Pitch Class Set Theory and its Contexts” by Michael Schuijler (2008) Cohen, Allen Laurence (2004).

  "text": "Solmization is a system which associates a syllable with each note of a musical scale. There are various forms of solmization used throughout the world. In Europe and North America, solfège is the most common practice. In this system, the seven syllables for a major scale are do, re, mi, fa, so, la and ti. In the ‘fixed-do’ system, the syllable “do” is always associated with the pitch “c”, while in the ‘movable-do’ system, “do” is associated with the tonic note. The @psolfa attribute is only allowed on note and uneume elements. Its value is unconstrained in order to accommodate various solmization systems. &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" psolfa=\"do\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" psolfa=\"re\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" psolfa=\"mi\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" psolfa=\"fa\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt;",

The following attributes are provided for this purpose: @metcon Indicates the relationship between the content of a staff or layer and the prevailing meter. @metcon Indicates the relationship between the content of a measure and the prevailing meter. When used on staff or layer elements, the @metcon attribute can be used to indicate if the duration of the contained events is equal to (“c”), less than (“i”), or greater than (“o”) that predicted by the time signature. When used on the measure element, @metcon takes a boolean value, where “true” indicates conformance by all staff and layer descendants of the measure. In the first example below, the layer, staff, and measure all match the prevailing meter. In the second example, however, the first layer does not comply with the meter, making the staff containing it and measure as a whole non-compliant. When there is a single layer or when all the layers on a staff agree with each other, metrical compliance can be indicated on the staff element. When, however, not all layers have the same value for @metcon, then it is necessary to omit @metcon at the staff level. The value of @metcon on the measure level can usually be computed based on the values of its layer and staff sub-elements. &lt;!-- in 2/4 --&gt;&lt;measure metcon=\"true\" n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;!-- in 2/4 --&gt;&lt;measure metcon=\"false\" n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer metcon=\"i\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;layer metcon=\"true\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt;",

  "title": "Common Music Notation Ornaments",
  "text": "This module includes elements and attributes for the encoding of ornaments typical of ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN). Ornaments are formulae of embellishment that can be realized by adding supplementary notes to one or more notes of the melody. In written form, these are usually expressed as symbols written above or below a note, though some have a more complex written expression, such as those that involve multiple notes and/or include grace notes. These symbols may have different resolutions depending on a large number of factors, such as historical context, national boundaries, composer, scribe, etc. The elements described here, therefore, are not bound to a specific symbol; they are, instead, meant to encode the encoder’s interpretation of a symbol and its position on the staff. Nonetheless, in order to establish common ground, the guidelines suggest commonly accepted symbols and realizations for the ornaments supported by MEI. The following sections will introduce each element in detail for all types of ornaments supported.",

  "title": "Encoding Common To All Ornaments",
  "text": "When encoding CMN, ornaments should be encoded within a measure, following the staff elements, and connected to events on the staff via attributes. The @startid attribute is used to refer to the @xml:id of the starting note. Additionally, if the ornament involves more than one events on the staff, the @endid attribute can be used to anchor the ornament to a concluding event. The following example demonstrates the encoding of an inverted mordent over a middle C: &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"cmnOrnaments.co_1_n1\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;mordent form=\"inv\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" startid=\"co_1_n1\"&gt;&lt;/mordent&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Alternatively, the relationship of an ornament to a note can be expressed in terms of beats with the attribute @tstamp. If the ornament involves more than one event on the staff, the @tstamp2 attribute can be used to indicate the ending time stamp, as is explained in section Timestamps and Durations. These methods may also be utilized simultaneously. The following example shows the use of @tstamp for an ornament. Assuming that the following measure is in 2/2, the ornament (in this case, a mordent) is related to the note on the second beat. &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;mordent form=\"inv\" place=\"below\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/mordent&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The relationship between an ornament and the notes on staff must always be encoded. It is, in fact, a semantic error not to specify a starting event or time stamp for an ornament. In their resolution, ornaments will involve auxiliary notes, which typically follow the key signature or the scale of the current key. When the ornament involves other chromatic auxiliaries, an accidental is expressed next to or above the ornament sign. The attributes @accidlower and @accidupper, available on all ornaments described in this chapter, can be used to record this accidental. The attribute values ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ indicate whether the accidental is associated with an upper or lower auxiliary note, not the position of the accidental sign.",

  "title": "Overriding Default Resolutions",

Nevertheless, because of the great historical and geographical variance in the notation of ornaments, the encoder is given methods to override the default resolutions. It is possible, for example, to specify in the meiHead a new default sounded resolution for an ornament. As discussed in the section Encoding Description, the element encodingDesc holds a description (optional, but recommended) of the methods and editorial principles which govern the transcription or encoding of the source material. Let us take a trill as an example. The section regarding Trills does not set a specific number of alternations between the principal and secondary notes; the encoder, however, may specify an exact number in the encoding description. &lt;encodingDesc&gt; &lt;editorialDecl&gt; &lt;p&gt;All trills should be resolved by playing three alternations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/editorialDecl&gt; &lt;/encodingDesc&gt; Alternatively, resolutions can be defined on a case-by-case basis by encoding a specific resolution using the choice element.

The presence of a mordent is encoded with the mordent element and its attributes: mordent An ornament indicating rapid alternation of the main note with a secondary note, usually a step below, but sometimes a step above. @form Traditionally, the 'normal' mordent is written as a short wavy line with a vertical line through it and the inverted mordent is written without the vertical line. However, the meaning of these signs is sometimes reversed. See Read, p. 245-246. Another attribute in the visual domain would be necessary in order to be completely explicit about which visual symbol is actually to be rendered. @long When the long attribute is set to 'yes', a double or long mordent, consisting of 5 notes, is indicated. @accidlower Records the written accidental associated with a lower neighboring note. @accidupper Records the written accidental associated with an upper neighboring note. It is recommended, but not required, to use the attribute @form to encode the typology of mordents. Two common types are supported: those mordents that involve a note lower than the principal note, and those that involve a note higher than the principal note. The attribute @form accepts the following values: norm: usually corresponding to the symbol: . This mordent is commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its lower neighbor, with a return to the principal note. inv: usually corresponding to the symbol: . This mordent is commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its upper neighbor, with a return to the principal note. The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple mordents: Example of simple mordent &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;mordent form=\"inv\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/mordent&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Occasionally, mordents can be longer, employing five notes instead of three. The @long attribute can be used to identify mordents of this type. The following example shows the encoding of a long mordent: Example of a long mordent &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;mordent form=\"inv\" long=\"true\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/mordent&gt; &lt;/measure&gt;",

A trill is encoded with the trill element and its attributes: trill Rapid alternation of a note with another (usually at the interval of a second above). @accidlower Records the written accidental associated with a lower neighboring note. @accidupper Records the written accidental associated with an upper neighboring note. Trills in modern notation are usually expressed with the abbreviation “tr” above a note on the staff. Often the abbreviation is followed by a wavy line that indicates the length of the trill. The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple trills: Example of simple trills. &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;rest dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/rest&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; It has been specified earlier that it is a semantic error not to encode a starting event or time stamp for an ornament. This starting point of a trill can be expressed with the @startid attribute and/or with the @tstamp attribute. Specifying the end point is not required, although the @tstamp2 attribute can be used to indicate the use of a wavy line extender as shown in this example: Example of trills followed by wavy lines. &lt;scoreDef&gt; &lt;staffGrp&gt; &lt;staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.sig=\"2f\" lines=\"5\" n=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;/staffGrp&gt; &lt;/scoreDef&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"g\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\" tstamp2=\"3\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"n\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3\" tstamp2=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\" tstamp2=\"5\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; Chromatic alterations of auxiliary notes are occasionally expressed on the staff using small notes enclosed in parentheses, as shown in the example below. However, the attribute @accidupper is still to be used to encode the alteration. Display of the auxiliary note in this ‘cautionary’ manner is left to down-stream rendering processes. Example alterations expressed on the staff. &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Some trills may be introduced by a turn or followed by an inverted turn leading to the next note (see Le garzantine, Musica 2003, p. 911). In such cases, the trill is encoded as in previous examples and associated with the principal note. Starting or concluding turns are notated on the staff (in layer) as Grace Notes. The following example, from a keyboard sonata by Joseph Haydn, shows a trill with concluding grace notes: Haydn, Sonata in D major, Hoboken XVI:33 (Wiener Urtex no. 34), mvmt. 1. &lt;measure n=\"2\" xml:id=\"cmnOrnaments.d1e412\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note accid.ges=\"s\" dur=\"32\" grace=\"unacc\" oct=\"6\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"up\" xml:id=\"cmnOrnaments.d1e414\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"b\" stem.dir=\"down\" xml:id=\"cmnOrnaments.d1e432\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" grace=\"unacc\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" grace=\"unacc\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"b\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;trill ho=\"+1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"2.5\" vo=\"6.5\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/measure&gt;",

  "text": "Symbols and abbreviations for trills have changed and evolved considerably throughout history. Strategies to clarify the encoding and interpretation of ornaments have been discussed in section Overriding Default Resolutions above. However, in order to aid the encoder in making educated choices in the encoding of non-standard trills, this section shows two examples diverging from modern standard use. The abbreviation “tr” followed by a wavy line spanning multiple notes is sometimes used to indicate multiple trills: Example of multiple trills. The encoding of this kind of trill may vary depending on the purpose of the encoding. For representation of the source, a single trill is sufficient: &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;rest dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/rest&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; To support analytical and aural rendering applications, however, each trill may be explicitly encoded, as the following example demonstrates: &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;rest dur=\"8\"&gt;&lt;/rest&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; However, when it is necessary to support multiple outputs, use of the choice element and appropriate sub-elements is recommended. In this case, the orig and reg elements can be used to represent the original source and a regularization provided by the editor, respectively: &lt;choice&gt; &lt;orig&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/orig&gt; &lt;reg&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/reg&gt; &lt;/choice&gt; Another situation that requires disambiguation of an ornament’s name and its potential rendition is due to the fact that the symbols for trills and mordents have been often used interchangeably in the past. The following example, taken from Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (1720), shows a trill (Trillo) identified by the symbol associated with a mordent in modern practice. Nonetheless, J.S. Bach’s suggested resolution should be encoded with a variant of the procedure presented above. In the example below, the child elements of choice; that is, orig and reg, represent non-exclusive options; that is, both may be processed by applications that aim to support both visual and aural renditions. Trill transcribed from J.S. Bach's \"Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach\" (1720) &lt;measure n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;choice&gt; &lt;orig&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/orig&gt; &lt;reg&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/reg&gt; &lt;/choice&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Depending on the purpose of the encoding, it may be more convenient to encode the regularized text within the stream of events, along with a corresponding choice with regard to the existence of the trill marking, as in the following example: &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;choice&gt; &lt;orig&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/orig&gt; &lt;reg&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/reg&gt; &lt;/choice&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;choice&gt; &lt;orig&gt; &lt;trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/trill&gt; &lt;/orig&gt; &lt;reg&gt;&lt;/reg&gt; &lt;/choice&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The orig element contains the single-note-with-trill transcription of the original text, while the reg element represents the realization-without-trill version. This approach facilitates substitution of the realization of the trill for the original written note (as well as the opposite procedure) and is therefore the recommended markup for applications where exchange of this kind is desirable.",

  "text": "A turn is an ornament that typically consists of four notes: the upper neighbor of the principal note, the principal note, the lower neighbor, and the principal note again. The presence of a turn is encoded with the turn element and its attributes: @form Indicates the style of the turn. @delayed When the delayed attribute is set to 'true', the turn begins on the second half of the beat. See Read, p. 246. @accidlower Records the written accidental associated with a lower neighboring note. @accidupper Records the written accidental associated with an upper neighboring note. It is recommended, but not required, to use the attribute @form to encode the typology of the turn. The attribute @form accepts the following values: norm: usually corresponding to the symbol: . This turn is commonly performed beginning on a note higher than the principal note. inv: usually corresponding to the symbol: . This turn is commonly performed beginning on a note lower than the principal note.

To indicate this, the turn symbol is typically written in between the principal note and the next. These kind of turns are encoded with the attribute @delayed.

This element allows the encoder to represent ornaments as textual strings (e.g. with a Unicode symbol) or with a user defined symbol. Chromatic auxiliaries can be represented with @accidlower and @accidupper. The ornam element can also be a control element. That is, it can be linked via its attributes to other events. The starting point of the directive may be indicated by either a tstamp, tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid attribute, while the ending point may be recorded by either a tstamp2, dur, dur.ges or endid attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach used non-standard ornaments in the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach: Table of ornaments used by Johann Sebastian Bach in the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach The ornament for (5) doppelt-cadence could be encoded in the following way, by adopting the Unicode code-points defined by the SMuFL standard: &lt;ornament tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&amp;amp;#xe5c0;&lt;/ornament&gt; A resolution, or expansion of the ornament can be provided as discussed in Special Cases below.",

  "text": "The term corpus may refer to any collection of musical data, although it is often reserved for collections which have been organized or collected with a particular end in view, generally to illustrate a particular characteristic of, or to demonstrate the variety found in, a group of related texts. The principal distinguishing characteristic of a corpus is that its components have been selected or structured according to some conscious set of design criteria. In MEI, a corpus is regarded as a composite text because, although each discrete document in a corpus clearly has a claim to be considered as a text in its own right, it is also regarded as a subdivision of some larger object, if only for convenience of analysis. In corpora, the component samples are clearly distinct texts, but the systematic collection, standardized preparation, and common markup of the corpus often make it useful to treat the entire corpus as a unit, too. Corpora share a number of characteristics with other types of composite texts, including anthologies and collections. Most notably, different components of composite texts may exhibit different structural properties, thus potentially requiring elements from different MEI modules. Aside from these high-level structural differences, and possibly differences of scale, the encoding of language corpora and the encoding of individual texts present identical sets of problems. Therefore, any of the encoding techniques and elements presented in other chapters of these Guidelines may therefore prove relevant to some aspect of corpus encoding and may be used in corpora.",

  "title": "Corpus Module Overview",
  "text": "The meiCorpus module defines a single element: meiCorpus (MEI corpus) – A group of related MEI documents, consisting of a header for the group, and one or more &lt;mei&gt; elements, each with its own complete header. The meiCorpus element is intended for the encoding of corpora, though it may also be useful in encoding any collection of disparate materials. The individual samples in the corpus are encoded as separate mei elements, and the entire corpus is enclosed in an meiCorpus element. Each sample has the usual structure for a mei document, comprising an meiHead followed by a music element. The corpus, too, has a corpus-level meiHead element, in which the corpus as a whole, and encoding practices common to multiple samples may be described. The overall structure of an MEI-conformant corpus is thus: &lt;meiCorpus&gt; &lt;meiHead type=\"corpus\"&gt; &lt;!-- metadata for the corpus --&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead type=\"text\"&gt; &lt;!-- metadata for sample 1 --&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- the encoding of sample 1 --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt; &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead type=\"text\"&gt; &lt;!-- metadata for sample 2 --&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- the encoding of sample 2 --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt; &lt;/meiCorpus&gt; This two-level structure allows for metadata to be specified at the corpus level, at the individual text level, or at both. However, metadata which relates to the whole corpus rather than to its individual components should be removed from the individual component metadata and included only in the meiHead element prefixed to the whole. In some cases, the design of a corpus is reflected in its internal structure. For example, a corpus of musical incipits might be arranged to combine all compositions of one type (symphonies, songs, chamber music, etc.) into some higher-level grouping, possibly with sub-groups for date of publication, instrumentation, key, etc. The meiCorpus element provides no support for reflecting such internal structure in the markup: it treats the corpus as an undifferentiated series of components, each tagged with an mei element. If it is essential to reflect the organization of a corpus into sub-components, then the members of the corpus should be encoded as composite texts instead, using the group element described section Music Element. The mechanisms for corpus characterization described in this chapter, however, are designed to reduce the need to do this. Useful groupings of components may easily be expressed using the classification and identification elements described in section Classification, and those for associating declarations with corpus components described in section Associating Metadata and Data. These mechanisms also allow several different methods of text grouping to co-exist, each to be used as needed at different times. This helps minimize the danger of cross-classification and mis-classification of samples, and helps improve the flexibility with which parts of a corpus may be characterized for different applications. All composite texts share the characteristic that their different component texts may be of structurally similar or dissimilar types. If all component texts may all be encoded using the same module, then no problem arises. If however they require different modules, then the various modules must all be included in the schema.",

  "title": "Combining Corpus and Text Headers",
  "text": "An MEI-conformant document may have more than one header only in the case of a TEI corpus, which must have a header in its own right, as well as the obligatory header for each text. Every element specified in a corpus-header is understood as if it appeared within every text header in the corpus. An element specified in a text header but not in the corpus header supplements the specification for that text alone. If any element is specified in both corpus and text headers, the corpus header element is over-ridden for that text alone. The titleStmt for a corpus text is understood to be prefixed by the titleStmt given in the corpus header. All other optional elements of the fileDesc should be omitted from an individual corpus text header unless they differ from those specified in the corpus header. All other header elements behave identically, in the manner documented in chapter The MEI Header. This makes it possible to state information which is common to the whole of the corpus in the corpus header, while still allowing for individual texts to vary from this common metadata. For example, the following markup shows the structure of a corpus consisting of three texts, the first and last of which share the same encoding description. The second one has its own encoding description. &lt;meiCorpus&gt; &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;!-- corpus file description--&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;encodingDesc&gt; &lt;!-- default encoding description --&gt; &lt;/encodingDesc&gt; &lt;revisionDesc&gt; &lt;!-- corpus revision description --&gt; &lt;/revisionDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;!-- file description for this corpus text --&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- first corpus text --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt; &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;!-- file description for this corpus text --&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;encodingDesc&gt; &lt;!-- encoding description for this corpus text, over-riding the default --&gt; &lt;/encodingDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- second corpus text --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt; &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;!-- file description for third corpus text --&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;!-- third corpus text --&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt; &lt;/meiCorpus&gt;",

For most large-scale corpus projects, it will therefore be necessary to determine a subset of recommended elements appropriate to the anticipated needs of the project; these mechanisms include the ability to exclude selected element types, add new element types, and change the names of existing elements. Because of the high cost of identifying and encoding many textual features, and the difficulty in ensuring consistent practice across very large corpora, encoders may find it convenient to divide the set of elements to be encoded into the following four categories: required: texts included within the corpus will always encode textual features in this category, should they exist in the text recommended: textual features in this category will be encoded wherever economically and practically feasible; where present but not encoded, a note in the header should be made. optional: textual features in this category may or may not be encoded; no conclusion about the absence of such features can be inferred from the absence of the corresponding element in a given text. proscribed: textual features in this category are deliberately not encoded; they may be transcribed as unmarked up text, or represented as gap elements, or silently omitted, as appropriate.",

An app element always encapsulates the differences between varying sources. Therefore, it must contain at least two child elements. Possible child elements are lem and rdg, which use the same model, but have a different meaning: Whereas lem is used for prioritizing one alternative, a rdg has no such additional meaning and simply indicates a reading as found in one or more sources. Accordingly, lem is allowed only once in app, whereas rdg may appear as often as necessary. &lt;app&gt; &lt;lem&gt; &lt;!-- preferred reading --&gt; &lt;/lem&gt; &lt;rdg&gt; &lt;!-- alternative reading --&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;rdg&gt; &lt;!-- alternative reading --&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;/app&gt; The rdg (and lem) elements use the @source attribute to point to one or more descriptions of the bibliographic sources containing the material they mark: &lt;!-- In the document content: --&gt;&lt;app&gt; &lt;rdg source=\"#critApp.source1\"&gt; &lt;!-- reading of source 1 --&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;rdg source=\"#critApp.source2 #critApp.source3\"&gt; &lt;!-- reading of sources 2 *and* 3 --&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;/app&gt; &lt;!-- Earlier in the document header: --&gt; &lt;sourceDesc&gt; &lt;source xml:id=\"critApp.source1\"&gt; &lt;!-- bibliographic description of source 1 --&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;source xml:id=\"critApp.source2\"&gt; &lt;!-- bibliographic description of source 2 --&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;source xml:id=\"critApp.source3\"&gt; &lt;!-- bibliographic description of source 3 --&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;/sourceDesc&gt; The @seq attribute may be used on lem or rdg to record the sequence of a series of readings. In the following example, the material in source B is marked as sequential to (and perhaps derived from) the reading in source A: &lt;app&gt; &lt;rdg seq=\"1\" source=\"#critApp.sourceA\"&gt; &lt;!-- material in source 1 --&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;rdg seq=\"2\" source=\"#critApp.sourceB\"&gt; &lt;!-- material in source 2 --&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;/app&gt; If a source has additional content that is not found in other sources, an empty rdg element may be used to indicate the lack of material in the other sources. In the following example, source 1 includes material that is not found in sources 2 and 3: &lt;app&gt; &lt;rdg source=\"#critApp.source1\"&gt; &lt;!-- additional content of source 1 --&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;rdg source=\"#critApp.source2 #critApp.source3\"&gt;&lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;/app&gt; When working with a large number of sources, it might seem tedious to provide references for all sources.

  "title": "Variants in Score Definitions",
  "text": "In addition to its use for differentiation of the musical content of multiple sources, app may also be utilized to describe the layout of different scores, even when the musical content itself remains the same. An example of this is two sources that have the same content, but a different ordering of staves on which the content is written. By definition, the order of staves is derived from the order of staffDef elements in scoreDef, not from the order of staff elements within a measure. The staff element in a measure points to its corresponding staffDef using either 1) the same value for @n on both elements, or 2) a value in @def which is an explicit reference to a particular staffDef using its @xml:id value. When using the first of these two approaches, it is possible to point dynamically to the correct staff definition for a given source. The following example demonstrates how this can be accomplished for two sources, both presenting a two-staff score, but with differing staff order. No further app element is necessary within the measure to describe the alternative score order of the sources. &lt;score&gt; &lt;app&gt; &lt;rdg source=\"#critApp.source1\"&gt; &lt;scoreDef&gt; &lt;staffGrp&gt; &lt;staffDef n=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;staffDef n=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;/staffGrp&gt; &lt;/scoreDef&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;rdg source=\"#critApp.source2\"&gt; &lt;scoreDef&gt; &lt;staffGrp&gt; &lt;!-- The order of &lt;staffDef&gt; elements defines score order, not its @n attribute! --&gt; &lt;staffDef n=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;staffDef n=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;/staffGrp&gt; &lt;/scoreDef&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;/app&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/staff&gt; &lt;staff n=\"2\"&gt;&lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/score&gt; When unique values for @n on layerDef and layer are provided, it is possible to reallocate layers in the same fashion as staves.

  "title": "Editorial Markup",
  "text": "It is often necessary to render an account of any changes made to a musical text during its creation (and any subsequent editing) and to accommodate editorial comment necessitated by an editorial process. The elements and attributes described in this chapter may be used to record such editorial interventions, whether made by the composer, the copyists of the manuscript, the editor of a earlier edition used as a copy text, or the current encoder/editor. The scope of the elements described herein is therefore the description of features relating to the genesis, later revision and editorial interpretation of a text. Mechanisms for describing multiple sources are described in chapter Critical Apparatus of these Guidelines. The elements described in this chapter may be contained by a wide range of other MEI elements and, in turn, may contain a variety of elements. The encoder must assume responsibility for the appropriateness of the markup; that is, a great many combinations of editorial and transcriptional markup are technically possible, but care must be taken to see that the encoding does not contravene the rationale of these Guidelines. For most of the elements discussed here, some encoders may wish to indicate both a responsibility; that is, a coded value indicating the person or agency responsible for making the editorial intervention in question, and an indication of the degree of certainty which the encoder wishes to associate with the intervention. Because these requirements are common to many of the elements discussed in this section, they are provided by an attribute class, att.edit, to which these elements subscribe. Any of the elements discussed here thus may potentially carry the following optional attributes: @cert Signifies the degree of certainty or precision associated with a feature. @resp Captures information regarding responsibility for some aspect of the text's creation, transcription, editing, or encoding. Its value must point to one or more identifiers declared in the document header. Many of the elements discussed here can be used in two ways. Their primary purpose is to indicate that their content represents an editorial intervention (or, in some cases, the lack of intervention) of a specific kind. Sometimes, pairs or other meaningful groupings of such elements can be recorded, then wrapped within the special purpose choice element: choice Groups a number of alternative encodings for the same point in a text. Wrapping elements this way enables the encoder to represent, for example, a text in its ‘original’, uncorrected form alongside the same text in one or more ‘edited’ forms. Making use of this style of representation, software may dynamically switch between the Urtext ‘view’ of the text and one or more ‘views’ of the text after the application of the encoded editorial interventions. Elements which can be combined in this way constitute the model.choicePart class. The default members of this class are sic, corr, reg, orig, unclear, add, and del; their functions and usage are described in greater detail below. Three categories of editorial intervention are discussed by the remainder of this chapter: indication or correction of apparent errors; indication of regularization of variant, irregular, non-standard, or eccentric forms; and editorial additions, suppressions, and omissions.",

Sample values include: suspension: the abbreviation provides the first letter(s) of the word or phrase, omitting the remainder; contraction: the abbreviation omits some letter(s) in the middle; brevigraph: the abbreviation comprises a special symbol or mark; superscription: the abbreviation includes writing above the line; acronym: the abbreviation comprises the initial letters of the words of a phrase; title: the abbreviation is for a title of address (Dr, Ms, Mr, …); organization: the abbreviation is for the name of an organization; geographic: the abbreviation is for a geographic name. This tag is the mirror image of the expan tag (not to be confused with the expansion element described in Content of Musical Divisions). Both abbr and expan allow the encoder to transcribe an abbreviation and its expansion. In the case of abbr, the original is transcribed as the content of the element and the expansion as an attribute value, while expan reverses this. The choice between the two is up to the user. For example: &lt;!-- using abbr --&gt;&lt;p&gt;... the next passage shall be performed in&lt;abbr expan=\"piano\"&gt;pno:&lt;/abbr&gt;... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- using expan --&gt; &lt;p&gt;... the next passage shall be performed in &lt;expan abbr=\"pno:\"&gt;piano&lt;/expan&gt;... &lt;/p&gt; The abbr tag is not required; if appropriate, the encoder may transcribe abbreviations in the source text silently, without tagging them. If abbreviations are not transcribed directly but expanded silently, then the MEI header should indicate this is the case. The @cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the expansion of the abbreviation. The @expan attribute gives an expansion of the abbreviation. The @resp attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the editor or transcriber responsible for supplying the expansion of the abbreviation. When the content of the @abbr or @expan attributes requires additional markup, an attribute cannot be used. In this case, the abbreviated and expanded forms must be presented within elements. Furthermore, as alternatives to each other, the abbr and expan elements must be wrapped by the choice element, as described above.

  "text": "Many musical scores make use of various kinds of shorthand notation which omit some parts of the score that have already been written elsewhere. Typical exampleS for this are symbols that indicate repetition of the preceding measure or beat. In MEI, these symbols can be encoded using the mRpt and beatRpt elements respectively. Often, similar graphical symbols (often one or two slashes, “//”) are used to mean that the current staff should have the same or similar content as another staff. colla parte directives have a less strictly-defined scope than the ‘Rpt elements’ ( beatRpt, halfmRpt, mRpt, mRpt2, multiRpt). That is, rather than specifying the repetition of content of a particular duration, like a measure or beat, colla parte instructions can refer to material of any length. In order to encode such scribal shorthand, MEI offers the cpMark element, which allows filling of blank spaces in the score with horizontally and/or vertically distant material. cpMark (copy/colla parte mark) – A verbal or graphical indication to copy musical material written elsewhere. Like any other ‘controlEvent’, cpMark is placed in the score using the @staff and @tstamp attributes. The end point of the mark itself, when necessary, may be indicated using the @tstamp2 attribute. The source material, which is intended to be inserted in the space indicated by the copy mark, can be identified by the attributes @origin.tstamp, @origin.tstamp2, @origin.staff and @origin.layer. While @origin.tstamp provides the relative distance from the beginning of the “gap”, @origin.tstamp is relative to the position identified by @origin.tstamp. However, @origin.tstamp defaults to the same value as @tstamp2 and should only be provided when necessary. When neither @origin.staff nor @origin.tstamp are not provided, they take the same values as the cpMark’s @staff and @tstamp attributes; that is, they indicate a strict ‘vertical’ or ‘horizontal’ copy. Copy marks in the first and second violin of C.M.v.Weber's Freischütz, Autograph, Nr.3 (Walzer), measures 223-231 In the example above, there are no less than three different copy instructions, which need to be encoded with four cpMark elements. First, Weber inserts characters from “a” to “f” in red ink to identify filled measures. Then, he repeats the same characters in empty measures, which indicates that the content from the filled measures should be copied here. While one could try to encode this with just one cpMark element, it is both clearer and easier to process when using two elements. The second and third shorthand indications are written in the second violin (lower staff). Here, Weber writes “unis.[ono]”, silently omitting the reference to the first violin. His next shorthand (“in 8va”) additionally instructs the copyist to double the written material in another octave. This information can be captured using the @dis and @dis.place attributes on cpMark. &lt;cpMark origin.tstamp=\"-6m+1\" staff=\"8\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"5m+4\"&gt;a. b. c. d. e. f. g.&lt;/cpMark&gt; &lt;cpMark origin.tstamp=\"-6m+1\" staff=\"9\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"5m+4\"&gt;a. b. c. d. e. f. g.&lt;/cpMark&gt; &lt;cpMark origin.staff=\"8\" staff=\"9\" tstamp=\"1.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+3.5\"&gt;unis:&lt;/cpMark&gt; &lt;cpMark dis=\"8\" dis.place=\"below\" origin.staff=\"8\" staff=\"9\" tstamp=\"2\" tstamp2=\"2m+3.5\"&gt;in 8va&lt;/cpMark&gt; A transcription of the example above with all shorthand resolved and colored Text used as a copy mark, like the letters in the Weber example, may be encoded as content of the cpMark element. In the case of non-text marks, the @altsym, @extsym and @facs attributes may be used to refer to a graphical surrogate. Depending on the purpose of the encoding, the omitted parts in the score may be filled with space and mSpace elements of appropriate duration or silently overwritten with the content that the cpMark identifies. Also, these two options may be combined through the use a choice element whose abbr and expan children explicitly encode a transcription of the original ‘gap’ (in abbr) and the result of the insertion of the indicated material (in expan).",

The elements described here enable all three approaches, and allows the last to be done is such a way as make it easy for software to present either the original or the correction. sic Contains apparently incorrect or inaccurate material. corr (correction) – Contains the correct form of an apparent erroneous passage. The following examples show alternative treatment of the same material. The text to be encoded contains a chord (c4, e4, g4, a4), where c4, e4, and a4 are quarter notes, but g4 is a half note. An encoder may choose to silently correct the engraver’s error: &lt;chord&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; or the correction may be made explicit: &lt;chord&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;corr&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/corr&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; Alternatively, the encoder may simply record the typographic error without correcting it, either without comment or with a sic element to indicate the error is not a transcription error in the encoding: &lt;chord&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;sic&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/sic&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; If the encoder elects to record the original source text and provide a correction for the sake of transparency, both sic and corr may be used, wrapped in a choice element.

Its value (#editTrans.JK) is an example of the pointer values discussed in section Pointers and References. In this case, the @resp attribute points to a name element within the metadata header, but any element might be indicated in this way, if the correction has been taken from some other source. The @resp attribute is available for all elements which are members of the att.responsibility class. The att.edit class makes available a @cert attribute,which may be used to indicate the degree of editorial confidence in a particular correction, as in the following example: &lt;chord&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;choice&gt; &lt;sic&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/sic&gt; &lt;corr cert=\"high\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/corr&gt; &lt;/choice&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; Where, as here, the correction takes the form of amending information present in the text being encoded, the encoder should use the corr element. Where the correction is present in the text being encoded, and consists of some combination of visible additions and deletions, the elements add or del should be used. For additional information on the use of add and del, see section Additions and Deletions below. Where the correction takes the form of an addition of material not present in the original because of physical damage or illegibility, the supplied element may be used. Where the ‘correction’ is simply a matter of expanding abbreviated notation, the expan element may be used.",

  "text": "When the musical source makes extensive use of unusual symbol shapes or non-standard notation features, it may be desirable for a number of reasons to regularize it; that is, provide ‘standard’ or ‘regularized’ forms that are equivalent to the non-standard forms. As with other such changes to the source text, the changes may be made silently (in which case the MEI header should still specify the types of silent changes made) or may be explicitly marked using the following elements: reg (regularization) – Contains material which has been regularized or normalized in some sense. orig (original) – Contains material which is marked as following the original, rather than being normalized or corrected. choice Groups a number of alternative encodings for the same point in a text. Consider this traditional soprano clef appearing somewhere in the course of a musical piece: An encoder may choose to preserve this original clef, but flag it as nonstandard from the perspective of current practice by using the orig element with no attributes specified, as follows: &lt;orig&gt; &lt;clef line=\"2\" shape=\"C\"&gt;&lt;/clef&gt; &lt;/orig&gt; Alternatively, the encoder may indicate that the clef has been modernized into a G-clef by using the reg element with no attributes specified, as follows: &lt;reg&gt; &lt;clef line=\"2\" shape=\"G\"&gt;&lt;/clef&gt; &lt;/reg&gt; As another alternative, the encoder may encode both the old and modernized shapes, so that applications may render both at the reader’s will: &lt;choice&gt; &lt;orig&gt; &lt;clef line=\"2\" shape=\"C\"&gt;&lt;/clef&gt; &lt;/orig&gt; &lt;reg&gt; &lt;clef line=\"2\" shape=\"G\"&gt;&lt;/clef&gt; &lt;/reg&gt; &lt;/choice&gt; As described above, the @resp attribute may be used to specify the agent responsible for the regularization.",

  "text": "Encoders may choose to omit parts of the source for reasons ranging from illegibility, (making transcription difficult or impossible), to editorial policy, e.g., systematic exclusion of poetry or prose from an encoding. The full details of the policy decisions concerned should be documented in the MEI header (see section Encoding Description). Each place in the text at which omission has taken place should be marked with a gap element, optionally with further information about the reason for the omission, its extent, and the person or agency responsible for it, as in the following examples: &lt;gap extent=\"2\" reason=\"illegible\" unit=\"quarter_note\"&gt;&lt;/gap&gt; &lt;gap extent=\"several notes\" reason=\"overwriting illegible\"&gt;&lt;/gap&gt; Note that the extent of the gap may be marked precisely using attributes @unit and @quantity, or more descriptively using the @extent attribute. Unlike TEI, MEI does not offer a desc element for further description of the reason for a gap. Instead, an annot may refer to the gap via its @startid, @endid, or @plist attributes and provide additional information. The unclear element is used to mark passages in the original which cannot be read with confidence, or about which the transcriber is uncertain for other reasons, as for example when transcribing a illegible source. Its @reason and @resp attributes are used, as with the gap element, to indicate the cause of uncertainty and the person responsible for the conjectured reading. &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt; &lt;unclear reason=\"ink blot\"&gt; &lt;artic artic=\"acc\"&gt;&lt;/artic&gt; &lt;/unclear&gt; &lt;/note&gt; Where the difficulty in transcription arises from an identifiable cause, the @agent attribute signifies the causative agent. The @cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the transcription of the text contained within the unclear element. Where the difficulty in transcription arises from action (partial deletion, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the @hand attribute may record the hand responsible for the action. When the reason for a gap in the encoding is damage of the document carrier (the paper on which the document is written, for example), the damage element should be used instead of the gap element. In the case of damage resulting from an identifiable cause, the @agent attribute signifies the causative agent. The @degree attribute signifies the degree of damage according to a convenient scale. A damage tag with this attribute should only be used where the text may be read with some confidence; data supplied from other sources should be tagged as supplied. The @extent attribute indicates approximately how much text is in the damaged area, in notes, measures, inches, or any appropriate unit, where this cannot be deduced from the contents of the tag. For example, the damage may span structural divisions in the text so that the tag must then be empty of content. In the case of damage (deliberate defacement, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the @hand attribute signifies the hand responsible for the damage. Sometimes the editor provides information not present in the source material. These conjectures or emendations are marked up in MEI using the supplied element. The following example demonstrates the use of the supplied element in combination with gap within subst: &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;subst&gt; &lt;gap extent=\"two eighth notes\" reason=\"missing notes\"&gt;&lt;/gap&gt; &lt;supplied&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/supplied&gt; &lt;/subst&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; When the presumed loss of text arises from an identifiable cause, @agent signifies the causative agent. When the presumed loss of text arises from action (partial deletion, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the @hand attribute signifies the hand responsible for the action. The @reason attribute indicates why the text has to be supplied, e.g. ‘overbinding’, ‘faded ink’, ‘lost folio’, ‘omitted in original’, etc. The @source attribute contains the source of the supplied text. The editor(s) responsible for supplied material may be recorded in the @resp attribute. The value of @resp must point to one or more identifiers declared in the document header.

  "text": "When several interventions to the musical text are to be regarded as a single action, they may be grouped using the subst element. The most common combination is a replacement of portions of the musical text using both the add and del element, as seen in the following example: &lt;layer&gt; &lt;!-- preceding content --&gt; &lt;subst&gt;&lt;del&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;add&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/add&gt; &lt;/subst&gt; &lt;!-- subsequent content --&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; An intervention closely related to substitution is the restoration of a previously deleted section. For this purpose MEI offers the restore element, which may contain a del or other content directly. The following example illustrates an instance where a lyric which was cancelled and later restored by overwriting it: &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt; &lt;syl&gt; &lt;restore desc=\"overwritten\"&gt;&lt;del&gt;God&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/restore&gt; &lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/note&gt; The @desc attribute gives a prose description of the means of restoration. The @cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the identification of the hand of the restoration. The @type attribute may be used to indicate the action cancelled by the restoration. The @resp attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the editor or transcriber responsible for identifying the hand of the restoration. The @hand attribute signifies the hand of the agent which made the restoration. MEI offers a handShift milestone element that can be used to mark a change of scribe or scribal style. The @character attribute describes characteristics of the hand, particularly those related to the quality of the writing, e.g., ‘shaky’, ‘thick’, regular’. A description of the tint or type of ink, e.g., ‘brown’ or the writing medium, e.g., ‘pencil’, may be placed in the @medium attribute. &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note pname=\"f\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;handShift medium=\"blue ink\"&gt;&lt;/handShift&gt; &lt;note pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; The new hand may be identified using the @new attribute, while the previous hand may be recorded in the @old attribute. The @resp attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the editor or transcriber responsible for identifying the change of hand. The @cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the identification of the new hand. When using this element within a layer, it is important to ensure that all layers and staves are considered. Every handShift affects only the content of its own layer and staff, even in the following measures. Therefore, there must be a separate handShift for every staff and layer.

These element are used to add a separate subtree to MEI, starting with the facsimile element inside music, as seen in the following example: &lt;mei&gt; &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;!-- metadata header --&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;facsimile&gt; &lt;!-- The facsimile subtree starts here. --&gt; &lt;/facsimile&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- The encoding of the musical content goes here. --&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/music&gt; &lt;/mei&gt; It is possible to have more than one facsimile element in this location. This is especially useful when multiple sources are encoded in the same file using the mechanisms described in chapter Editorial Markup of these Guidelines. In this case, the @decls (declarations) attribute of facsimile may be used to refer to a source defined in the document’s header, as seen in the following example: &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;source xml:id=\"facsimile.source1\"&gt; &lt;!-- description of source --&gt; &lt;/source&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; &lt;music&gt; &lt;facsimile decls=\"#facsimile.source1\"&gt; &lt;!-- facsimile content --&gt; &lt;/facsimile&gt; &lt;/music&gt; Within a facsimile element, each page of the source is represented by a surface element. Each surface may be assigned an identifying string utilizing the @label attribute. In addition, it may encapsulate more detailed metadata about itself in a figDesc element. The coordinate space of the surface may be recorded in abstract terms in the @ulx, @uly, @lrx, and @lry attributes. For navigation purposes, surface has a @startid attribute that accommodates pointing to the first object appearing on this particular writing surface. &lt;facsimile&gt; &lt;surface label=\"page 1\" lrx=\"2000\" lry=\"3000\" startid=\"#measure1\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/surface&gt; &lt;/facsimile&gt; Within surface elements, one may nest one or more graphic elements, each providing a reference to an image file that represents the writing surface. Multiple graphic elements are permitted in order to accommodate alternative versions (different resolutions or formats, for instance) of the surface image. In spite of changes in resolution or format, all images must contain the same content, i.e., the entire writing surface. &lt;facsimile&gt; &lt;surface&gt; &lt;graphic height=\"2000\" target=\"image1.jpg\" unit=\"px\" width=\"3000\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;graphic height=\"1000\" target=\"image1smaller.jpg\" unit=\"px\" width=\"1500\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;graphic height=\"200\" target=\"image1smallest.png\" unit=\"px\" width=\"300\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;/surface&gt; &lt;/facsimile&gt; The preceding markup will provide the basis for most page-turning applications. Often, however, it is desirable to focus attention on particular areas of the graphical representation of the surface. The zone element fulfills this purpose: &lt;surface lrx=\"3000\" lry=\"2000\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"&gt; &lt;graphic height=\"2000\" target=\"image1.jpg\" unit=\"px\" width=\"3000\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;zone lrx=\"370\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"300\" uly=\"200\"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;zone lrx=\"439\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"367\" uly=\"200\"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;zone lrx=\"512\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"436\" uly=\"200\"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;/surface&gt; The coordinates of each zone define a space relative to the coordinate space of its parent surface. Note that this is not necessarily the same coordinate space defined by the width and height attributes of the graphic that represents the surface. The zone coordinates in the preceding example do not represent regions within the graphic, but rather regions of the writing surface. Because the coordinate space of a zone is defined relative to that of a surface, it is possible to provide multiple graphic elements and multiple zone elements within a single surface. In the following example, two different images representing the entire surface are provided alongside specification of two zones of interest within the surface: &lt;surface lrx=\"3000\" lry=\"2000\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"&gt; &lt;graphic height=\"2000\" target=\"image1.jpg\" unit=\"px\" width=\"3000\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;graphic height=\"1995\" target=\"image1cropped.jpg\" unit=\"px\" width=\"2995\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;zone lrx=\"370\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"300\" uly=\"200\"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;zone lrx=\"30\" lry=\"30\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;/surface&gt; A zone element may contain figDesc or graphic elements that provide detailed descriptive information about the zone and additional images, e.g., at a different/higher resolution, of the rectangle defined by the zone. The data objects contained within the zone may also be specified through the use of the @data attribute, which contains ID references to one more elements in the content tree of the MEI file, such as a note, measure, etc. &lt;!-- In the facsimile subtree: --&gt;&lt;zone data=\"#facsimile.measure1\" xml:id=\"facsimile.zone1\"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;!-- somewhere in the content: --&gt; &lt;measure xml:id=\"facsimile.measure1\"&gt; &lt;!-- measure content --&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; Conversely, an element in the content may refer to the facsimile subtree using its @facs attribute, which is made available by the att.facsimile attribute class. The last example could therefore be encoded with pointers in the other direction: &lt;!-- In the facsimile subtree: --&gt;&lt;zone xml:id=\"facsimile.zone2\"&gt;&lt;/zone&gt; &lt;!-- somewhere in the content: --&gt; &lt;measure facs=\"#facsimile.zone2\" xml:id=\"facsimile.measure2\"&gt; &lt;!-- measure content --&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; The pb element defined in the Shared Elements, Models, and Attributes makes special use of the @facs attribute, in that it does not point to a zone, but a surface element instead. A pb marks the beginning of a page, so it can be concluded that all elements in the content tree which are encoded between any two pb elements encode musical symbols written on the page ( surface) referenced by the first of these two pb element’s @facs attribute.",

For example: &lt;fig&gt; &lt;graphic target=\"../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-300.png\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;/fig&gt; The graphic element may occur multiple times within the markup of the figure in order to indicate the availablity of different image formats or resolutions: &lt;fig&gt; &lt;graphic target=\"../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-72.png\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;graphic target=\"../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-300.png\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;graphic target=\"../samples/snippets/mei2012-30shortexamples/beam-grace/grace-600.png\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; &lt;/fig&gt;",

This element is intended for use as an alternative to the content of its parent fig element; for example, for display when the equipment in use cannot display graphic images.

  "text": "PNG: Portable Network Graphics format: PNG is a non-proprietary raster format currently widely available. It provides an extensible file format for the losslessly compressed storage of raster images. Indexed-color, grayscale, and true-color images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. It is defined by IETF RFC 2083, March 1997. TIFF: Tagged Image File Format: Currently the most widely supported raster image format, especially for black and white images, TIFF is also one of the few formats commonly supported on more than one operating system. The drawback to TIFF is that it actually is a wrapper for several formats, and some TIFF-supporting software does not support all variants. TIFF files may use LZW, CCITT Group 4, or PackBits compression methods, or may use no compression at all. Also, TIFF files may be monochrome, greyscale, or polychromatic. All such options should be specified in prose at the end of the encodingDesc section of the MEI header for any document including TIFF images. TIFF is owned by Aldus Corporation. Documentation on TIFF is available from the owner at Craigcook Castle, Craigcook Road, Edinburgh EH4 3UH, Scotland, or 411 First Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98104 USA. GIF: Graphics Interchange Format: Raster images are widely available in this form, which was created by CompuServe Information Services, but has by now been implemented for many other systems as well. Documentation is copyright by, and is available from, CompuServe Incorporated, Graphics Technology Department, 5000 Arlington Center Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio 43220 USA. PBM: Portable Bit Map: PBM files are easy to process, eschewing all compression in favor of transparency of file format. PBM files can, of course, be compressed by generic file-compression tools for storage and transfer. Public domain software exists which will convert many other formats to and from PBM. Documentation of PBM is copyright by Jeff Poskanzer, and is available widely on the Internet. PCX: IBM PC raster format: This format is used by most IBM PC paint programs, and supports both monochrome and polychromatic images. Documentation is available from ZSoft Corporation, Technical Support Department, ATTN: Technical Reference Manual, 450 Franklin Rd. Suite 100, Marietta, GA 30067 USA.

Almost any text structure can be presented as a series of rows and columns: one might, for example, choose to show a glossary or other form of list in tabular form, without necessarily regarding it as a table. When tabular presentation is regarded as of less intrinsic importance, it is correspondingly simpler to encode descriptive or functional information about the contents of the table, for example to identify one cell as containing a name and another as containig a date, though the two methods may be combined. The table element may appear both within other components (such as paragraphs), or between them, provided that the module defined in this chapter has been enabled. It is to a large extent arbitrary whether a table should be regarded as a series of rows or as a series of columns. For compatibility with currently available systems, however, these Guidelines require a row-by-row description of a table.

  "title": "Interpreted Chord Data in scoreDef",
  "text": "An harmonic label, such as “7”, may occur many times throughout an MEI instance. Where the goal is diplomatic transcription, simply recording the uninterpreted label is sufficient. Recording the precise meaning of such a label requires storing an interpretation. But, including the interpretation at every point of occurrence of the label would swell the size of the file and complicate the markup for those users who are not interested in the interpretation. Therefore, MEI separates the encoding of harmonic labels from the encoding of the interpretation of those labels. The following elements enable the creation and re-use of interpreted chord data: chordTable Chord/tablature look-up table. chordDef (chord definition) – Chord tablature definition. @pos Records the fret position at which the chord tablature is to be played. chordMember An individual pitch in a chord defined by a &lt;chordDef&gt; element. @inth Encodes the harmonic interval between pitches occurring at the same time. @fing Indicates which finger, if any, should be used to play an individual string. The index, middle, ring, and little fingers are represented by the values 1-4, while 't' is for the thumb. The values 'x' and 'o' indicate muffled and open strings, respectively. @fret Records the location at which a string should be stopped against a fret. barre An indication of fingering in a chord tablature grid. @fret Records the location at which a string should be stopped against a fret. The chordTable element is a container for a set of chord definitions, while the chordDef element defines a single chord. Chord definitions may be created a priori or as the result of analysis of the pitch content of the music at hand, for instance, by examination of the notes occurring on the downbeat of each measure. In this way, the chord definitions serve as a record of the analysis. Even though it is not required by the schema, an @xml:id attribute on chordDef is necessary to permit the creation of associations between harmonic indications in the musical text with the chord defined here. The @xml:id attribute provides a unique identifier for the chord definition that can be referenced by the harm element’s @chordref attribute. Individual pitches of a chord are encoded using chordMember. The @inth attribute provides the means for indicating the number of half steps of the chord note above the bass note. These simple resources allow for the detailed specification and interpretation of harmonic indications found in the musical text. For example, the harmonic label A can be equated with a fully spelled-out indication of functional harmony that can be substituted for the harmonic label, say, in an aural rendition:&lt;div class=\"sampleCode\" data-lang=\"false\"&gt; &lt;!-- Chord defined in scoreDef --&gt;&lt;chordDef xml:id=\"harmonychordA\"&gt; &lt;chordMember oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember accid.ges=\"s\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;/chordDef&gt; &lt;!-- Later in musical text --&gt; &lt;harm chordref=\"#harmonychordA\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;A&lt;/harm&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Alternatively, the non-bass chord tones may be indicated, not with pitch names, but with their intervallic distance above the bass note. Therefore, the example above may also be encoded: &lt;chordDef xml:id=\"harmonychordA2\"&gt; &lt;chordMember oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember inth=\"7\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember inth=\"16\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember inth=\"19\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember inth=\"24\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;/chordDef&gt; The preceding encoding possibilities provide the detailed information necessary to create playable chord annotations. For more generic uses, however, the encoding can be taken one step further; that is, it can be reduced to its minimum intervallic content by eliminating octave duplications and expressing all chord members, including the bass note, using intervals above the bass. Of course, the @inth attribute for the bass note itself should be set to 0. For example: &lt;chordDef xml:id=\"harmonychordA3\"&gt; &lt;chordMember inth=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember inth=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;chordMember inth=\"7\"&gt;&lt;/chordMember&gt; &lt;/chordDef&gt;",

Therefore, MEI provides only a single element for the capture of harmonic indications of all kinds: @extender Indicates the presence of an extension symbol, typically a line. @rendgrid Describes how the harmonic indication should be rendered. The harm element can be used to capture chord labels that consist entirely of text: &lt;harm tstamp=\"1\"&gt;Cmaj&lt;/harm&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"2\"&gt;ii6&lt;/harm&gt; or labels that are chord tablature grids: Chord grid without label &lt;harm chordref=\"#harmonychordA\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/harm&gt; or labels that mix these styles: Chord grid with label &lt;harm chordref=\"#harmonychordA\" rendgrid=\"gridtext\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;A7&lt;/harm&gt; The harm element must define a point of attachment using one of the following attributes: @startid, @tstamp, @tstamp.ges or @tstamp.real. The most commonly-used of these are @startid and @tstamp. The @dur attribute encodes the logical and visual duration of the harmony.

  "text": "Figured bass is a specialized form of harmonic indication. In order to support the capture of the semantics of figured bass, and not just its visual representation, MEI provides the following elements: fb (figured bass) – Symbols added to a bass line that indicate harmony. Used to improvise a chordal accompaniment. Sometimes called Generalbass, thoroughbass, or basso continuo. @extender Indicates the presence of an extension symbol, typically a line. Figured bass, consisting as it does of text, can always be represented purely visually. This is probably how an OMR program or other naive encoder might deal with the markup of figured bass: Figured bass &lt;harm place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt;6&lt;/harm&gt; However, this kind of approach fails to recognize that a figured bass is being used and not some other system of harmonic indications. To capture this knowledge, the preceding example can also be marked more explicitly with: &lt;harm place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;6&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; In order to provide greater control over the individual components of the figured bass, each component can be treated as a figure. The natural symbol is encoded using the Unicode MUSIC NATURAL SIGN character. Figured bass with accidental &lt;harm place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;7&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;♮&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; Encoding order of the component f elements is significant as is the encoding order of the characters within each component. In the preceding example, the entire figured bass sign is encoded from top to bottom, in other words, just as the figure appears on the page. In the following examples, the encoding order of the characters in f explicitly locates the accidentals: Figured bass with chromatically altered figure &lt;harm place=\"below\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;7♭&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; Figured bass with chromatically altered figures &lt;harm&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;6&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;4+&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;♮3&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; Characters with combining slashes can be handled using the Unicode characters COMBINING REVERSE SOLIDUS OVERLAY (6⃥) and COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY (6̸). The combining nature of these Unicode characters indicates very clearly that they “overstrike” the preceding character. The usual convention for slashes; that is, 6\\ and 6/ for backslash and slash, respectively, may also be followed: Figured bass with chromatically altered figure &lt;harm&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;6⃥&lt;/f&gt; &lt;!-- or --&gt; &lt;f&gt;6\\&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; Each component of the figured bass sign may use the @extender attribute to indicate that horizontal lines are used to mark the extent of the figure’s harmonic influence. The @altsym attribute can be used to point to a user-defined symbol that better represents the figure component, for example, the combined “2” and “+” below. Similar to the slash in the preceding example before, the small curve over the “5” in example 6 can be represented by the Unicode COMBINING INVERTED BREVE. Figured bass with alternative sign &lt;harm tstamp=\"1\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;̑&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f extender=\"true\"&gt;5&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f altsym=\"combo2plus\"&gt;2+&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"3\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;3&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; Because the repertoire of signs is so large, figures which consist entirely of a mark indicating repetition of the preceding figure, should be represented by the character appearing in the document. For example, in some notational styles, the repetition sign is a dash (-), while in others it is a solidus (/). Using characters like this is also consistent with other existing figured bass encoding schemes. Figured bass repetition &lt;harm tstamp=\"1.5\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;-&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; Often, the distinction between extending lines and repetition signs is unclear. Treating what at first appear to be extenders as repetition signs, however, can sometimes help to simplify the required markup and to make the intent of the signs explicit. For example, in the following example the dashes on beat 4 and 4.5 are treated as repetition signs: Extenders and repetition &lt;harm tstamp=\"3.5\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;♭3&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;6&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;5&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"4\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;-&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;♯3&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"4.5\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;7&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;-&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; Using @extender attributes for this example may make it easier to render the figured bass symbol, but it is less explicit with regard to the intended harmony. For example, it is difficult to ascertain what harmony should be sounding on beat 4 and its after-beat. &lt;harm tstamp=\"3.5\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;♭3&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f extender=\"true\"&gt;6&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;5&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"4\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f extender=\"true\"&gt;♯3&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"4.5\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;7&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; The primary goal of fb is not the capture all the visual idiosyncracies that can be found in printed and manuscript scores throughout the centuries, but to provide a more-or-less standardized label. The markup below, or any markup in fact, cannot capture the exact look of the figured bass signs. The @altsym attribute may be used to provide access to a user-defined symbol for precise rendition. Similarly, the @facs attribute may be employed to point to the symbol as it occurs in the encoding source material. Figured bass with alternative sign &lt;!-- Ex. a --&gt;&lt;harm tstamp=\"3\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;8&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f altsym=\"#my6_1\" facs=\"#source6_1\"&gt;6♮&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;4+&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;2&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"4\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f altsym=\"#my6_2\" facs=\"#source6_2\"&gt;6\\&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;4&lt;/f&gt; &lt;f&gt;3&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;!-- Ex. b --&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"4.5\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;6\\&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;!-- Ex. c --&gt; &lt;harm tstamp=\"1\"&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f&gt;5/&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt; &lt;!-- Ex. d --&gt; &lt;harm&gt; &lt;fb&gt; &lt;f altsym=\"#my5\" facs=\"#source5\"&gt;5+&lt;/f&gt; &lt;/fb&gt; &lt;/harm&gt;",

As such, this text should not be confused with other text on the score, for which see Shared Textual Elements and Text in MEI These guidelines suggest two methods for encoding text in vocal notation: encoding syllables Vocally Performed Text Encoded Within Notes and encoding performed text Vocally Performed Text Encoded Separately (and other staff events) either within layer elements or within measure elements when available (for example in a Common Music Notation context). Each method may be more convenient depending on the source text and on the textual phenomena that the encoding intends to record. Both methods eventually rely on the syl element, which is part of the ‘shared’ module and is therefore available in all MEI files. The following sections will begin by introducing the general use of syl and then show in detail the two different encoding methods.",

  "title": "Lyric Syllables",
  "text": "By ‘lyric syllable’, these guidelines mean a word or portion of a word that is to be performed vocally. Each syllable is encoded with the syl element, with which it is also possible to specify the position of the syllable in a word, the type of connectors between syllables, alignment adjustments, and the formatting for each syllable. These are the key components: syl (syllable) – Individual lyric syllable. @wordpos Records the position of a syllable within a word. @con Describes the symbols typically used to indicate breaks between syllables and their functions. @halign Records horizontal alignment. The attribute @wordpos is used to specify the position of the marked-up lyric syllable in a word. It allows the following values: i: Indicates that the current syllable’s position is initial; that is, at the beginning of a word; m: Indicates that the current syllable is in the middle of a word; t: Indicates that the syllable’s position is terminal; that is, at the end of a word. When a syllable is at the beginning or in the middle of a word (in which case it will have the @wordpos attribute set to ‘i’ or ‘m’), it is recommended to specify the type of connector written between the current and the following syllable. This is expressed with the @con attribute, which takes the following values: s: A space is used as a connector between syllables; d: A dash is used as a connector between syllables; u: An underscore sign (indicating prologation of the syllable) is used as a connector between syllables; t: A tilde is used to indicate elision with the following syllable. This is typically rendered as a small curved line between the syllables. Occasionally, a word or a final syllable needs to be extended across multiple notes. In this case an ‘extender’ is provided. An extender is a continuous line drawn at the text’s baseline from the end of the syllable associated with the first note until the last note to be sung with the syllable. The use of syl described in this section is common to CMN and other notation systems, such as mensural notation. Other uses specific to certain types of notation and repertoires are addressed in other chapters. See for example Neume Notation.",

  "title": "Vocally Performed Text Encoded Within Notes",
  "text": "Each lyric syllable can be encoded directly within an associated note, either by using the @syl attribute on note or the verse element. Using the @syl attribute on notes is the simplest way of encoding vocally performed text and is recommended only for simple situations or for those encodings which do not focus on vocally performed text. The following example from Handel’s Messiah (HWV 56) shows the use of @syl: Handel, Messiah HWV 56, Halleluja &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" syl=\"Hal-\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" syl=\"le-\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" syl=\"lu-\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" syl=\"jah,\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;rest dur=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/rest&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; When there are multiple lines of vocally performed text, or the encoder wishes to be more specific about connectors, etc., the use of verse and syl is recommended. verse Lyric verse. @rhythm Used to specify a rhythm for the lyric syllables that differs from that of the notes on the staff, e.g. '4,4,4,4' when the rhythm of the notes is '4.,8,4.,8'. The following example from Handel’s Messiah (HWV 56) shows the use of verse: &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"i\"&gt;Hal&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"m\"&gt;le&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;beam&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"m\"&gt;lu&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl wordpos=\"t\"&gt;jah,&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;rest dur=\"4\"&gt;&lt;/rest&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; As it is common practice in written text, it is assumed that a space separates words. Many vocal texts, however, introduce elisions and connect two syllables into one unit. For example, the vocal text from Mozart’s Don Giovanni sung by Don Giovanni in Finale II, Ho fermo il core in petto introduces an elision between the word fermo and il and between core and in. An elision can be indicated by placing both syllables within the same note and setting the syl element’s @con attribute value to ‘t’: &lt;note&gt; &lt;verse&gt; &lt;syl con=\"t\" wordpos=\"t\"&gt;re&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;syl wordpos=\"i\"&gt;in&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; When there is more than one line of text, more than one verse element can be used. The following example from a piano reduction of Wagner’s Rheingold has two lines of text, with an English translation on the second line. Note the use of the @xml:lang attribute to differentiate the two languages: Example from Wagner's Rheingold with translated text. &lt;scoreDef&gt; &lt;staffGrp&gt; &lt;staffDef clef.line=\"4\" clef.shape=\"F\" key.sig=\"4s\" lines=\"5\" n=\"1\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; &lt;/staffGrp&gt; &lt;/scoreDef&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\" xml:lang=\"ger\"&gt; &lt;syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"i\"&gt;Rei&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;verse n=\"2\" xml:lang=\"eng\"&gt; &lt;syl&gt;thinks&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl wordpos=\"t\"&gt;fes&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;verse n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;syl&gt;it&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl&gt;zu&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;verse n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;syl&gt;were&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"i\"&gt;wal&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;verse n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;syl&gt;wise&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"d\" stem.dir=\"down\"&gt; &lt;accid accid=\"n\"&gt;&lt;/accid&gt; &lt;verse n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;syl wordpos=\"t\"&gt;ten,&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;verse n=\"2\"&gt; &lt;syl&gt;now&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;rest dur=\"4\" dur.ges=\"8p\"&gt;&lt;/rest&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; Optionally, it is possible to include an lb element within verse to explicitly encode line and line group endings.

These are the main components: lyrics Vocally performed 'text' of a musical composition, such as a song or opera. @staff Signifies the staff on which a notated event occurs or to which a control event applies. Mandatory when applicable. @layer Identifies the layer to which a feature applies. Since this element is separated from the encoding of the notes, it must be associated with a staff that will provide rhythm information when required for automated processing. The @staff attribute gives the associated staff and if there is more than one layer on that staff, the @layer attribute may be used to indicate the layer from which the rhythm should be taken. If there is any divergence between the rhythm of the vocally performed text and the notes, the @rhythm attribute on verse may be used to specify the text’s rhythm. The following example from Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz illustrates this encoding method: Weber, Der Freischütz &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\"&gt; &lt;artic artic=\"acc\"&gt;&lt;/artic&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\"&gt; &lt;artic artic=\"acc\"&gt;&lt;/artic&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;lyrics staff=\"1\"&gt; &lt;verse&gt; &lt;syl&gt;Sturm&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;syl&gt;und&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/lyrics&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\" tie=\"i\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;lyrics staff=\"1\"&gt; &lt;verse&gt; &lt;syl&gt;Nacht!&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/lyrics&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\" tie=\"t\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; In this encoding style, a syl element with its @con attribute set to ‘t’ and the following syllable are presumed to be associated with a single note.

In earlier versions of MEI, the noteOn and noteOff elements were used to record MIDI note on/off events. The use of these elements is now discouraged in favor of using the note element directly. MIDI duration should be recorded using the @dur.ges attribute, and MIDI pitch information should be recorded using the @pnum attribute. MIDI control changes ( cc) are encoded using the @num and @val attributes. Control change numbers are specified in the General MIDI documentation. In the example below, the cc elements encode increasing controller event 7 (volume) values, or in musical terms, a crescendo. Other MIDI event messages follow this same pattern, using the @num and @val attributes to record the raw MIDI data. &lt;measure&gt; &lt;staff&gt; &lt;layer&gt; &lt;note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"45\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"42\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"43\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"44\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;midi layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"&gt; &lt;cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\".5\" val=\"50\"&gt;&lt;/cc&gt; &lt;cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\"1.5\" val=\"55\"&gt;&lt;/cc&gt; &lt;cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\"2\" val=\"60\"&gt;&lt;/cc&gt; &lt;cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\"2.5\" val=\"65\"&gt;&lt;/cc&gt; &lt;/midi&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; In the preceding example, each control change is associated with a time stamp. The @tstamp attribute is required in order to indicate when the MIDI event should take place. It is often necessary to indicate a time stamp slightly earlier than the affected notes to compensate for MIDI delay. For better legibility and error checking, the midi element may be used, as in the following example, to group MIDI parameter changes. Even so, the @tstamp attribute is required on all parameters in order to associate them with their point of actuation: &lt;midi layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"&gt; &lt;cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\".5\" val=\"50\"&gt;&lt;/cc&gt; &lt;cc num=\"64\" tstamp=\".5\" val=\"64\"&gt;&lt;/cc&gt; &lt;/midi&gt;",

In section Names, Dates, Numbers, Abbreviations, and Addresses it was noted that the elements provided in the core module allow an encoder to specify that a given text segment is a proper noun. The elements provided by the present module allow the encoder to supply a detailed sub-structure for such proper nouns, and to distinguish explicitly between persons and organizations, and between stylistic, periodical or geographical indications. The chapter begins by discussing the elements provided for the encoding of names ( name) and dates ( date) in general and finishes by addressing more specific elements for corporate names ( corpName), geographic names ( geogName), period names ( periodName), personal names ( persName) and style names ( styleName). In general it is recommended to use standardized forms of proper nouns and to record the names and web-accessible locations of the controlled vocabularies used. There are several commonly-referenced authority files, especially for geographical, organizational and personal names, such as the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND), the Library of Congress Authorities, the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), and the MARC code list for relators. Recommendations on which standards could be used can be found in the descriptions of the individual elements.",

  "title": "Basic Elements for Names and Dates",
  "text": "The basic elements for capturing names and dates are defined in the shared module: name Proper noun or noun phrase. date A string identifying a point in time or the time period between two such points. The name element contains the name of an entity that is difficult to tag more specifically as a corpName, geogName, persName, or title. In section Names, Dates, Numbers, Abbreviations, and Addresses it was noted that the name element may be used in place of the more specific elements when it is not known what kind of name is being described or when a high degree of precision is not necessary. For example, the name element might be used when it is not clear whether the name “Bach” refers to a person or a geographic feature. When name parts are needed, use name sub-elements. The recommended values for the @type attribute are: ‘pers’: a personal name ‘corp’: the name of a corporate entity ‘place’: a geographic name ‘process’: the name of a process or mechanical agent The date sub-element is available within name in order to record any dates associated with the name, for example, creation and dissolution in the case of a corporate entity or place or birth and death dates in the case of an individual. The name of the list from which a controlled value is taken, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF), may be recorded using the authority attribute. Examples of the use of the name element: &lt;name type=\"pers\"&gt;Henry VIII, King of England&lt;/name&gt; &lt;name type=\"corp\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/name&gt; &lt;name type=\"place\"&gt;Orbach&lt;/name&gt; &lt;name type=\"process\"&gt;OMR software&lt;/name&gt; The element date contains a date in any format, including a date range. A date range may be expressed as textual content or, when intervening punctuation is present, as a combination of date sub-elements and text. &lt;date&gt;5/3/05&lt;/date&gt; &lt;date&gt;May 30, 2012&lt;/date&gt; &lt;date&gt;March 1-21, 1812&lt;/date&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;date&gt;March 1, 1812&lt;/date&gt;- &lt;date&gt;March 21, 1812&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/date&gt; To be more specific about the date, the attributes in the att.datable class can be used: startdate: contains the starting point of a date range in standard ISO form enddate: contains the end point of a date range in standard ISO form notbefore: contains a lower boundary for an uncertain date notafter: contains an upper boundary for an uncertain date isodate: gives the value of a textual date in standard ISO form calendar: indicates the system or calendar to which a date belongs, for example, Gregorian, Julian, Roman, Mosaic, Revolutionary, Islamic, etc. cert: signifies the degree of certainty or precision associated with a feature (high, medium, low, unknown) In the following example, the ambiguous date text “5/3/05” is resolved using the @isodate attribute: &lt;date isodate=\"1905-05-03\"&gt;5/3/05&lt;/date&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"2005-03-05\"&gt;5/3/05&lt;/date&gt;",

Corporate names are non-personal names which refer to structured bodies of one or more persons that act as a single entity. Typical examples include associations, businesses, projects or institutions (e.g.,. ‘the Royal College of Music’ or ‘the BBC’), but also racial or ethnic groupings or political factions where these are regarded as forming a single agency. Organization names typically include some type of indicator or pattern or words that help identify them as non-personal names. The corpName element is frequently used within the The MEI Header of an MEI document. It is typically found in the respStmt element: &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;corpName&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/corpName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; It may also be used wherever it is necessary to mark a corporate name, for example when a corporation is responsible for a certain event in the history of a musical work: &lt;history&gt; &lt;eventList&gt; &lt;event&gt; &lt;p&gt;First performance by &lt;corpName&gt;The Boston Symphony Orchestra&lt;/corpName&gt;, &lt;date&gt;October 22, 1881&lt;/date&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/event&gt; &lt;/eventList&gt; &lt;/history&gt; When it is necessary to provide structure for a name, the separate parts of the name may be encoded in corpName sub-elements, for example: &lt;corpName&gt;Federal Research Division, &lt;corpName&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/corpName&gt; &lt;/corpName&gt; Standard designations for corporate bodies can be taken from a controlled vocabulary, such as the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND).

The encoder may use these attributes in combination. In case of the German city of Frankfurt, for example, a clarification whether Frankfurt am Main or Frankfurt an der Oder is meant can be achieved by referring to the ID of the TGN entry: &lt;!-- Frankfurt am Main --&gt;&lt;geogName authURI=\"www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn\" authority=\"TGN\" dbkey=\"7005293\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/geogName&gt; &lt;!-- Frankfurt an der Oder --&gt; &lt;geogName authURI=\"www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn\" authority=\"TGN\" dbkey=\"7005972\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/geogName&gt; The names of places given within addresses can be marked with geogName elements, for example: &lt;corpName authURI=\"http://d-nb.info/gnd\" authority=\"GND\" dbkey=\"2007744-0\"&gt;German Research Foundation&lt;/corpName&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;addrLine&gt;Kennedyallee 40&lt;/addrLine&gt; &lt;addrLine&gt;53175 &lt;geogName authURI=\"www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn\" authority=\"TGN\" dbkey=\"7005090\"&gt;Bonn&lt;/geogName&gt; &lt;/addrLine&gt; &lt;addrLine&gt; &lt;geogName authURI=\"www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn\" authority=\"TGN\" dbkey=\"7000084\"&gt;Germany&lt;/geogName&gt; &lt;/addrLine&gt; &lt;/address&gt;",

Personal names within an MEI document may simply be marked with the persName element containing a proper noun or proper noun phrase referring to an individual. Personal names, however, often consist of several components, like forenames and surnames, but also other components, such as inherited or life-time titles of nobility, honorific or academic prefixes, military ranks or traditional descriptive phrases. These components may be marked using name sub-elements, the function of which may be indicated using the @type attribute. In this case, @type attribute may take the following values: ‘forename’: contains a forename, given or baptismal name. ‘surname’: a family (inherited) name, as opposed to a given, baptismal, or nick name. ‘rolename’: contains a name component which indicates that the referent has a particular role or position in society, such as an official title or rank. ‘addname’ (additional name): contains an additional name component, such as a nickname, epithet, or alias, or any other descriptive phrase used within a personal name. ‘namelink’ (name link): contains a connecting phrase or link used within a name but not regarded as part of it, such as van der or of. ‘genname’ (generational name): contains a name component used to distinguish otherwise similar names on the basis of the relative ages or generations of the persons named. &lt;persName&gt; &lt;name type=\"forename\"&gt;Henry&lt;/name&gt; &lt;name type=\"genname\"&gt;VIII&lt;/name&gt;, &lt;name type=\"rolename\"&gt;King of England&lt;/name&gt;, &lt;date&gt;1491-1547&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName&gt; &lt;name type=\"surname\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/name&gt;, &lt;name type=\"forename\"&gt;William&lt;/name&gt; &lt;name type=\"forename\"&gt;Boyd&lt;/name&gt;, &lt;name type=\"rolename\"&gt;Earl of&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/persName&gt; The persName element is often enclosed in the respStmt element which may occur within titleStmt, pubStmt, seriesStmt and change.

For example: &lt;persName role=\"arranger\"&gt;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName role=\"lyricist\"&gt;Heinrich Heine&lt;/persName&gt; The Marc code list for relators offers a variety of controlled terms that may serve as values for this use of @role. For names in the metadata header, the use of a controlled list, such as the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND) or the Library of Congress Name Authorities, is recommended. The name and web-accessible location of the list may be recorded using the @authority and @authURI attributes, respectively. To record a value which serves as a primary key in an external database, the @dbkey attribute may be used. For maximal machine-processability, these three attributes may be used in combination.

  "title": "Style Names",
  "text": "styleName (style name) – A label for a characteristic style of writing or performance, such as 'bebop' or 'rock-n-roll'. Music can be divided into different styles, genres, and forms. The term style denotes a mode of expression, or more particularly, the manner in which a work of art is executed: “In the discussion of music, which is orientated towards relationships rather than meanings, the term raises special difficulties; it may be used to denote music characterized of an individual composer, of a period, of a geographical area or center, or of a society or social function. For the aesthetician style concerns surface or appearance, though in music appearance and essence are ultimately inseparable. For the historian a style is a distinguishing and ordering concept, both consistent of and denoting generalities; he or she groups examples of music according to similarities between them.” (Source: “Style”, Grove Music Online, accessed: April 27, 2012) The name of a musical style can be marked by the styleName element, for example: &lt;styleName&gt;bebop&lt;/styleName&gt; It may be, e.g., used for recording a style name within a title: &lt;title&gt;La voix du &lt;styleName&gt;bebop&lt;/styleName&gt; &lt;/title&gt; or to record a style of a certain epoch by using the styleName sub-element: &lt;periodName&gt;Modern &lt;styleName&gt;Jazz&lt;/styleName&gt; &lt;/periodName&gt; If a controlled value is used, the list, from which it is taken should be recorded.

  "text": "The following elements are available to encode information about a recorded performance: performance A presentation of one or more musical works. recording A recorded performance. avFile (audio/video file) – References an external digital audio or video file. clip Defines a time segment of interest within a recording or within a digital audio or video file. when Indicates a point in time either absolutely (using the absolute attribute), or relative to another when element (using the since, interval and inttype attributes). The performance element begins a subtree of the music element and appears alongside with, or instead of, body (described in Music Element and facsimile (described in Facsimiles). A performance element represents one recorded performance event. As a performance may be recorded in multiple formats or by different personnel or or using different equipment, the performance element may group one or more recordings of the event. The @decls attribute can be used to point to performance medium metadata for the performed work. See Performance Medium for more details. The recording element identifies a single recording event taking place within an absolute temporal space. The class att.mediabounds contains attributes that can be used to define this space: @begin Specifies a point where the relevant content begins. A numerical value must be less and a time value must be earlier than that given by the end attribute. @end Specifies a point where the relevant content ends. If not specified, the end of the content is assumed to be the end point. A numerical value must be greater and a time value must be later than that given by the begin attribute. @betype Type of values used in the begin/end attributes. The begin and end attributes can only be interpreted meaningfully in conjunction with this attribute. The avFile element identifies an external file associated with a recording act. In the simplest case, the recording element will contain one avFile element identifying a file that represents it. The @target attribute contains the URI of the digital media file. Use of the @mimetype attribute is recommended for the avFile element. Its value should be a valid MIME media type defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 2046. It is also recommended that all avFile elements have a recording or clip parent which bears the @begin, @end, and @betype attributes. &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/wav\" target=\"http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; Sometimes, multiple digital files are created in order to provide greater flexibility in redistribution and playback capabilities. In this case, multiple avFile elements may occur, each with a different mimetype. Keep in mind, however, that each file still represents the complete temporal extent of the recording act in spite of the change of file format: &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/wav\" target=\"http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/mpeg\" target=\"http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; The clip element identifies a temporal segment of a recording act. In the following example, the clip begins two minutes into the timeframe of the recording and ends 20 seconds later: &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:02:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:20:20.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; Beyond these relatively simple uses, complex situations may occur that require equally complex markup. For example, a single performance may be represented by multiple digital media files. Because they have differing durations, the media files must be the result of separate recording acts, even if these recording acts took place at the same time: &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/wav\" target=\"http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:15.00\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/mpeg\" target=\"http://example.com/path/to/audio/recording\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; A single performance may also be represented by multiple, sequential digital files, as when a complete work is recorded in several so-called ‘takes’. In this case, the files may be considered to be parts of a single recording act, the extent of which is the combined extent of the individual clips. For example, a series of clip elements may be used to identify each movement of a piece and give start and end times for the movements in relation to the overall temporal space of the complete work: &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:07:00.00\" n=\"mov1\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/aiff\" target=\"movement01.aiff\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/clip&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:07:01.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:12:03.00\" n=\"mov2\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/aiff\" target=\"movement02.aiff\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/clip&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; Similar markup is also applicable when a single file representing the entirety of a recording act is broken into segments later, as is often done for practical storage and distribution reasons. The file from which the clips are derived is indicated using an avFile element: &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:12:03.00\" n=\"completeWork\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/aiff\" target=\"completeWork.aiff\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:07:00.00\" n=\"mov1\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/aiff\" target=\"movement01.aiff\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/clip&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:07:02.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:12:03.00\" n=\"mov2\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/aiff\" target=\"movement02.aiff\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/clip&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; A clip may be used to define any region of interest, such as a cadenza or a modulation, a song verse, etc. The following example shows the use of clip and its attributes to identify significant sections of a recording: &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:05:21.00\"&gt; &lt;!-- Exposition --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:41.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- Development --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:01:41.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:14.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- Recapitulation --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:03:14.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:04:28.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- Coda --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:04:28.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:05:21.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; The preceding example also demonstrates that media files are not required in order to define the temporal space of a recording act or clip. This makes it possible to set the boundaries of these features, then use the content of the performance element as a rudimentary “edit decision list” to create the matching digital files. If an encoding of the notated text with which the media files are associated is included in the MEI file, the @startid attribute can be used to indicate the first element in the sequence of events to which the recording corresponds: &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:07:00.00\" n=\"mov1\" startid=\"#performance.m1_1\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/aiff\" target=\"fullpiece.aiff\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure n=\"1\" xml:id=\"performance.m1_1\"&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/score&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/body&gt; Clips can also be aligned with components of the musical text encoded in the body. The @startid attribute can be used to specify the starting element in the sequence of events to which the clip corresponds. The following example shows the use of of clip elements to identify the exposition of the first movement from Beethoven’s piano sonata Op. 14, no. 2 and its concluding ‘codetta’. &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:05:21.00\"&gt; &lt;avFile mimetype=\"audio/aiff\" target=\"BeethovenOp14N2-Mov1.aiff\"&gt;&lt;/avFile&gt; &lt;!-- Exposition --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:0.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:41.00\" startid=\"#performance.m1\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- Exposition's \"codetta\" --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:01:31.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:41.00\" startid=\"#performance.m48\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure n=\"1\" xml:id=\"performance.m1\"&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;measure n=\"48\" xml:id=\"performance.m48\"&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/score&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;/body&gt; Please note that the begin and end times of clips may overlap. In the preceding example, the extent of the codetta is contained within that of the exposition. Overlapping beginning and ending points may also be used to provide additional performance context for a segment or because there is uncertainty with regard to precise values for these points. &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:06.54\"&gt; &lt;!-- a section of interest --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:00:41.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- the following section starts a little before the end of the previous one to give some \"adjustment\" time --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:31.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:07.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- the boundaries of the following section are \"fuzzy\" --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:02:18.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:02:49.85\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; A bibliographic description of a recording or metadata explaining how clip boundaries were determined may be associated with the recording and clip elements via the @decls attribute: &lt;performance&gt; &lt;recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" decls=\"#performance.recBibDesc\" end=\"00:03:06.54\"&gt; &lt;!-- a section of interest --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:00:41.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- the following section starts a little before the end of the previous one to give some \"adjustment\" time --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:00:31.00\" betype=\"time\" decls=\"#performance.clipDesc\" end=\"00:01:07.00\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;!-- the boundaries of the following section are \"fuzzy\" --&gt; &lt;clip begin=\"00:02:18.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:02:49.85\"&gt;&lt;/clip&gt; &lt;/recording&gt; &lt;/performance&gt; Associations between a feature of the encoding, such as a note, dynamic mark, or annotation, and a time point, may be created using when elements and @when attributes. The when element identifies a particular point in time during the playback of a media file, such as an audio recording. &lt;when absolute=\"00:00:01.915291666\" xml:id=\"t1\"&gt;&lt;/when&gt; Time points may be identified in absolute terms as above; that is, in hours, minutes, and seconds since the beginning of the recording, or in relative terms using the @interval, @inttype, and @since attributes. In the following example, the time point of interest happens 48 frames after the occurrence of the point labelled as “t1”. &lt;when interval=\"48\" inttype=\"smpte-ndf29.97\" since=\"#t1\" xml:id=\"t1.1\"&gt;&lt;/when&gt; Having identified a point of interest, another feature of the encoding may be associated with this point using its @when attribute: &lt;annot plist=\"#LvB\" when=\"#t1\"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like this part!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/annot&gt; One use of the association created between the annotation and the time point is to display the text of the annotation as the recording or clip is played. The @when attributes allows only a single value, so only one-to-one relationships can be created using this mechanism. However, one-to-many relationships are accommodated in the opposite direction; that is, from a time point to other features of the markup. For example, &lt;when absolute=\"00:00:01.915291666\" data=\"#feature1 #feature2 #feature3\" xml:id=\"t1.2\"&gt;&lt;/when&gt; indicates that the entities identified in @data all occur at the same instant.",

  "title": "Links",
  "text": "An element is a ‘link’ when it has an attribute whose value is a reference to the ID of one or more other elements. The links discussed in this chapter are the ptr and the ref elements. These elements indicate an association between themselves (or one of their ancestors) and one or more other entities, either inside the same document or elsewhere. An association between two elements in the same document is said to be an ‘internal’ link, while an association that involves an entity outside the current document is called an ‘external’ link. However, either element can be used for either purpose. The two elements share a set of common attributes that are inherited from the att.pointing class: @target: allows the use of one or more previously-undeclared URIs to identify an external electronic object. @targettype: in contrast with the role attribute, allows the target resource to be characterized using any convenient classification scheme or typology. @xlink:actuate: defines whether a link occurs automatically or must be requested by the user. @xlink:show: defines how a remote resource is rendered. @xlink:title: contains a human-readable description of the entire link. @xlink:role: indicates a property of the entire link. The value of the role attribute must be a URI. The @target attribute specifies the destination of a pointer or reference using a method standardized by the W3C consortium, known as the XPointer mechanism. The XPointer framework is described at http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/. This mechanism permits a range of complexity, from the very simple (a reference to the value of the target element’s @xml:id attribute) to the more complex usage of a full URI with embedded XPointers: &lt;!-- element ID --&gt;&lt;ptr target=\"#SA\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;!-- relative URL --&gt; &lt;ptr target=\"myFile.xml\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;!-- absolute URL --&gt; &lt;ptr target=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;!-- URL with fragment identifier --&gt; &lt;ptr target=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-xpointer/#xpointer(id('chum')/quote)\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;!-- URN --&gt; &lt;ref target=\"urn:isan:0000-0000-9E59-0000-O-0000-0000-2\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/ref&gt; The @targettype attribute allows the target resource to be characterized using any convenient classification scheme or typology. This is often useful when the target requires special processing, e.g., for display purposes. The two pointers in the example below may be formatted differently, e.g., the bibliographic citation may result in special typography while the pointer to the audio file may be used to embed an audio player: &lt;ptr target=\"#cit1\" targettype=\"biblioCitation\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;ptr target=\"http://path.to.resource/myAudio.aiff\" targettype=\"audioClip\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; The @xlink:actuate and @xlink:show attributes are used in conjunction to determine the link’s behavior. The attribute @xlink:actuate defines whether the resolution of a link occurs automatically or must be requested by the user. The following values are allowed for the @xlink:actuate attribute: ‘onLoad’: load the target resource immediately ‘onRequest’: load the target resource upon user request, e.g., after a mouse click ‘other’: traversal behavior is unconstrained; application should look for other markup to determine appropriate behavior ‘none’: traversal behavior is unconstrained; no other markup is provided to determine appropriate behavior The value “none” may be used to indicate that the link is un-traversable; it may or may not render the link invisible to the user. When the value of @xlink:actuate is “other”, an application must base a determination of appropriate behavior on factors other than the value of @xlink:actuate. The @show attribute defines how a remote resource is to be rendered. The following values are permitted: ‘new’: target of the link appears in a new window ‘replace’: target of the link replaces the current resource ‘embed’: the content of the target appears at the point of the link ‘other’: traversal behavior is unconstrained; application should look for other markup to determine appropriate behavior ‘none’: traversal behavior is unconstrained; no other markup is provided to determine appropriate behavior When the value of @xlink:show is “other”, an application must base a determination of appropriate behavior on factors other than the value of @xlink:show. The value “none” may be used to indicate a link that is not displayed or is not displayable. The following example illustrates a pointer that results in the automatic creation of a new window with the content of the target loaded in it: &lt;ptr xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\" mimetype=\"text\" target=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt\" xlink:actuate=\"onLoad\" xlink:show=\"new\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; The @xlink:title and @xlink:role attributes describe the meaning of resources within the context of a link. The @xlink:title attribute is used to label or describe a link or resource in a human-readable fashion. The value here is highly dependent on the kind of processing being done. It may be used, for example, to make link titles available to applications used by visually impaired users, or to create a table of links, or to present help text that appears when a user’s mouse hovers over the link. &lt;ptr xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\" target=\"http://www.music-encoding.org\" xlink:title=\"hompage of the MEI Project\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; The attribute@ xlink:role serves a similar function to that of @xlink:title. Whereas the value of @xlink:title may be any string, the value of @xlink:role must be an absolute URI reference as defined in IETF RFC 3986, available at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986. The URI reference identifies a resource that describes the intended property. When no value is supplied, no particular role value is to be inferred. &lt;ptr xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\" target=\"joe.xml\" xlink:role=\"http://www.example.com/linkprops/student\" xlink:title=\"Click here\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;ptr xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\" target=\"joe.xml\" xlink:role=\"http://www.example.com/linkprops/instructor\" xlink:title=\"Click here\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; In the preceding example, the value of the @xlink:role attribute may be used to re-write the value of @xlink:title, depending on the target resource role. In addition to the attributes in the att.pointing class, the @mimetype attribute is also available on ptr and ref. The function of the @mimetype attribute is similar to that of @targettype in that they both allow classification of the destination. Unlike @targettype, however, @mimetype explicitly defines the destination type using a standard taxonomy. Its value should be a valid MIME (Multimedia Internet Mail Extension) type defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 2046, available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt. The following are all valid mimetype values: &lt;ptr mimetype=\"application/pdf\" target=\"my.pdf\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;ptr mimetype=\"text/xml\" target=\"my.xml\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;ptr mimetype=\"image/png\" target=\"my.png\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; The @mimetype attribute is particularly useful for documenting the nature of the destination when the value of @target does not provide a filename extension or when the destination is a non-standard file type: &lt;ptr mimetype=\"application/pdf\" target=\"myFile1\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;ptr mimetype=\"application/x-myApplicationSpecificFile\" target=\"myFile2\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt;",

However, when the intention is to display a digital image as part of the rendering of an MEI file, the graphic element provides a convenient and recommended alternative: &lt;graphic mimetype=\"image/png\" target=\"myPic.png\"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt; While ptr cannot contain other markup, the ref element can include text and sub-elements that name or describe the destination: &lt;repository&gt; &lt;ref target=\"http://path.to.target/repo1.xml\"&gt; &lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;addrLine&gt;&lt;/addrLine&gt; &lt;/address&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;...&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/repository&gt; The @target attribute is not required in order to mark the textual content as a cross-reference, as demonstrated in the example below; however, without this attribute the reference will not be resolvable. &lt;p&gt;See &lt;ref&gt;Hankinson, Roland, Fujinaga (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;",

  "text": "The tablature module is used to record basic tablature notation. It is designed primarily for guitar and similar plucked-string instruments. The @lines attribute on the staffDef element is used to define the number of lines, courses, or strings, present in the tablature. The @tab.strings attribute is then used to enumerate the pitches of the open strings. It is important to note that this is given using the written pitch, not the sounding pitch. For example, the Western 6-string guitar, in standard tuning, sounds an octave below written pitch. The @tab.strings attribute gives the string tuning, ordered from highest to lowest pitch. For standard guitar tuning, the staffDef element might look like this: &lt;staffDef lines=\"6\" n=\"1\" tab.strings=\"e5 b4 g4 d4 a3 e3\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; Chromatic alteration of the open string’s pitch may be indicated with the ‘-‘ or ‘f’ (flat), or the ‘#’ or ‘s’ (sharp). Multiple sharps and flats are not permitted. A guitar in E-flat tuning might look like this: &lt;staffDef lines=\"6\" n=\"1\" tab.strings=\"ef5 bf4 gf4 df4 af3 ef3\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; Some instruments, like the 12-string guitar, have the four lowest strings tuned an octave above but are still written on a 6-line tablature staff. In this case, you may enumerate the open string pitches while maintaining 6 lines. &lt;staffDef lines=\"6\" n=\"1\" tab.strings=\"e4 e3 a4 a3 d4 d3 g5 g4 b4 b4 e5 e5\"&gt;&lt;/staffDef&gt; The note element is used to capture the specific events in the tablature. The @tab.string attribute is used to capture which string the note is to be played on. String order is the same as that given in the @tab.strings attribute. This attribute takes a positive integer in the range of 1-9. &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\" tab.string=\"3\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; In the case of fretted instruments, the fret number may be captured using the @tab.fret attribute. An open string may be indicated using the value “o”. &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tab.fret=\"5\" tab.string=\"6\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;note dur=\"4\" oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tab.fret=\"o\" tab.string=\"5\"&gt;&lt;/note&gt;",

This chapter, on the other hand, focuses on the text that accompanies the score, i.e., paratext (prefatory material, title pages, back matter, appendices, etc.), titles, prose, poetry, etc. Most of the elements described here take inspiration from encoding formats that deal primarily with text, such as HTML and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).

  "title": "Organizing Text into Divisions",
  "text": "Text can be organized in different parts, for example in chapters or sections. The div element is used to encode such structural divisions. div (division) – Major structural division of text, such as a preface, chapter or section. @type Characterizes the element in some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or typology. @subtype Provide any sub-classification for the element, additional to that given by its type attribute. For example, printed scores, before the actual notation, can have text that can be organized in multiple sections (e.g. a preface, a critical report, performance instructions, etc. for which see the following sections); each of these sections should be identified by a different div element. Text might also occur in between music sections (see Content of Musical Divisions), for example in a collection of romantic piano works, a few pieces might be preceded or followed by poetry. Such text should be encoded with the div element, as demonstrated in the following example: &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;score&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;!-- Score of Franz Liszt's \"Sonetto 104 del Petrarca --&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- Text of Francesco Petrarca's Sonett n. 104. --&gt; &lt;lg&gt; &lt;l&gt;L'aspectata vertù, che 'n voi fioriva&lt;/l&gt; &lt;l&gt;quando Amor cominciò darvi bataglia,&lt;/l&gt; &lt;!-- ... --&gt; &lt;/lg&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/score&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; Textual divisions may have titles or other forms of introductory material, which are encoded with the head element. head (heading) – Contains any heading, for example, the title of a section of text, or the heading of a list. The following example shows the encoding of a preface translated into three different languages, each with a different heading: &lt;div xml:lang=\"en\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;Preface &lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- text --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div xml:lang=\"de\"&gt; &lt;head&gt;Vorwort&lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- text --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div xml:lang=\"it\"&gt; &lt;head&gt;Prefazione&lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- text --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Having said that div identifies any structural organization of text, it is often helpful to distinguish the typology of division. The attributes @type and @subtype can be used for this purpose. It is required that @type be present when @subtype is used, though their values can be freely set by the encoder. The following example shows the use of @type to indicate three prefaces in English, German and Italian are columns on the same page. &lt;div n=\"1\" type=\"column\" xml:lang=\"en\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;Preface &lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- text --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div n=\"2\" type=\"column\" xml:lang=\"de\"&gt; &lt;head&gt;Vorwort&lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- text --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div n=\"3\" type=\"column\" xml:lang=\"it\"&gt; &lt;head&gt;Prefazione&lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- text --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;pb&gt;&lt;/pb&gt;",

A paragraph is encoded with the p element: p (paragraph) – One or more text phrases that form a logical prose passage. Prose text is used for several different purposes within a MEI document, therefore p can occur in many situations. For example, it may be used within metadata elements (see The MEI Header): &lt;samplingDecl&gt; &lt;p&gt;The encoding contains only the first 5 measures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/samplingDecl&gt; Alternatively, paragraphs may be part of the document contents (and therefore encoded within music), either as Paratext or within the music notation. In these cases, a paragraph will likely be contained by a div or other elements containing prose (e.g. annot, figDesc, etc.). The following example shows a paragraph in a preface section: &lt;front&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;The Preludes &lt;lb&gt;&lt;/lb&gt;Symphonic Poem No.3 by F.

The list element can identify any kind of list; the @form attribute can be used to specify whether the list is ordered, unordered etc. Each item in the list is encoded with the li element.

The quote element is used to mark this function: quote (block quote) – A formatting element that designates an extended quotation; that is, a passage attributed to a source external to the text and normally set off from the text by spacing or other typographic distinction. The following examples show the use of quote. &lt;p&gt;Hugh MacDonald has argued that Liszt's Symphonic Poems were meant to &lt;quote&gt;display the traditional logic of symphonic thought&lt;/quote&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of the works represented in this catalogue were purchased in Paris and London between 1928 and 1934.

  "title": "Front Matter",
  "text": "By ‘front matter’ these Guidelines mean distinct sections of a text (usually, but not necessarily, a printed one), prefixed to it by way of introduction or identification as a part of its production. Features such as title pages or prefaces are clear examples; a less definite case might be the prologue attached to a dramatic work. The front matter of an encoded text should not be confused with the MEI header described in chapter The MEI Header, which provides metadata for the entire file. An encoder may choose simply to ignore the front matter in a text, if the original presentation of the work is of no interest. No specific tags are provided for the various kinds of subdivision which may appear within front matter: instead, generic div (“division”) elements may be used, which should not be confused with mdiv (“musical division”) elements. The following suggested values for the @type attribute may be used to distinguish various kinds of division characteristic of front matter: ‘preface’: A foreword or preface addressed to the reader in which the author or publisher explains the content, purpose, or origin of the text. ‘ack’: A formal declaration of acknowledgement by the author in which persons and institutions are thanked for their part in the creation of a text. ‘dedication’: A formal offering or dedication of a text to one or more persons or institutions by the author. ‘abstract’: A summary of the content of a text as continuous prose. ‘contents’: A table of contents, specifying the structure of a work and listing its constituents. The list element should be used to mark its structure. ‘frontispiece’: A pictorial frontispiece, possibly including some text. The following extended example demonstrates how various parts of the front matter of a text may be encoded. The front part begins with a title page, which is presented in section Title Pages, below. This is followed by a dedication and a preface, each of which is encoded as a distinct div: &lt;front xmlns=\"http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron\"&gt; &lt;titlePage&gt; &lt;!-- transcription of title page --&gt; &lt;/titlePage&gt; &lt;div type=\"dedication\"&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- Dedicatory text --&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div type=\"preface\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;Preface &lt;/head&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- paragraph 1 --&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- paragraph 2 --&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- additional material --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/front&gt; The front matter concludes with another div element, shown in the next example, this time containing a table of contents, which contains a list element (as described in chapter Lists). Note the use of the ptr element to provide page-references: the implication here is that the target identifiers (song1, song2, etc.) will correspond with identifiers used for the mdiv elements containing the individual songs. (For a description of the ptr element, see chapter Pointers and References.) &lt;div type=\"contents\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;Contents &lt;/head&gt; &lt;list form=\"ordered\"&gt; &lt;li&gt;On Wenlock Edge &lt;ptr target=\"#song1\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;From Far, From Eve and Morning &lt;ptr target=\"#song2\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Is My Team Ploughing? &lt;ptr target=\"#song3\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Oh, When I Was In Love With You &lt;ptr target=\"#song4\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bredon Hill &lt;ptr target=\"#song5\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Clun &lt;ptr target=\"#song6\"&gt;&lt;/ptr&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/list&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Alternatively, the pointers in the table of contents might link to the page breaks at which a song begins, assuming that these have been included in the markup: &lt;list form=\"ordered\"&gt; &lt;li&gt;On Wenlock Edge &lt;ref target=\"#song1-p1\"&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;From Far, From Eve and Morning &lt;ref target=\"#song2-p15\"&gt;15&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;!-- .... --&gt; &lt;/list&gt; &lt;!-- Later in the document --&gt; &lt;mdiv type=\"song\"&gt; &lt;pb xml:id=\"song1-p1\"&gt;&lt;/pb&gt; &lt;!-- .... --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv type=\"song\"&gt; &lt;pb xml:id=\"song2-p15\"&gt;&lt;/pb&gt; &lt;!-- .... --&gt; &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;!-- .... --&gt;",

  "text": "Detailed analysis of the title page and other preliminaries of older printed books and manuscripts is of major importance in descriptive bibliography and the cataloging of printed books; such analysis, however, requires a more detailed approach than the general one described here. The following elements are suggested as a means of encoding the major features of most title pages for faithful rendition: titlePage Contains a transcription of the title page of a text. p (paragraph) – One or more text phrases that form a logical prose passage. table Contains text displayed in tabular form. list A formatting element that contains a series of items separated from one another and arranged in a linear, often vertical, sequence. quote (block quote) – A formatting element that designates an extended quotation; that is, a passage attributed to a source external to the text and normally set off from the text by spacing or other typographic distinction. lg (line group) – May be used for any section of text that is organized as a group of lines; however, it is most often used for a group of verse lines functioning as a formal unit, e.g. a stanza, refrain, verse paragraph, etc. The following example shows the encoding of the title page of Vaughan Williams’ On Wenlock Edge. Note the use of the lb element to mark the line breaks present in the original. &lt;titlePage&gt; &lt;p&gt;ON WENLOCK EDGE&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A CYCLE OF SIX SONGS &lt;lb&gt;&lt;/lb&gt;FOR TENOR VOICE ___ WITH ACCOMPANIMENT OF &lt;lb&gt;&lt;/lb&gt;Pianoforte and String Quartet (ad lib) &lt;lb&gt;&lt;/lb&gt;THE WORDS BY A.

One approach to this requirement would be to use the rend element, described in chapter Text Rendition to specify the rendition of each of the components of the title page. Another would be to employ a CSS stylesheet. Finally, a module customized for the description of typographic entities such as pages, lines, rules, etc., bearing special-purpose attributes to describe line-height, leading, degree of kerning, font, etc. could be employed.",

  "title": "Back Matter",
  "text": "Conventions vary as to which elements are grouped as back matter and which as front. For example, some books place the table of contents at the front, and others at the back. For this reason, the content models of the front and back elements are identical. The following suggested values may be used for the @type attribute on all division elements, in order to distinguish various kinds of divisions characteristic of back matter: ‘appendix’: An ancillary self-contained section of a work, often providing additional but in some sense extra-canonical text. ‘glossary’: A list of terms associated with definition texts (‘glosses’). ‘notes’: A section in which textual notes are gathered together. ‘bibliography’: A list of bibliographic citations. ‘index’: Any form of index to the work. ‘colophon’: A statement appearing at the end of a book describing the conditions of its physical production. No additional elements are proposed for the encoding of back matter at present. Some characteristic examples follow; first, an index (for the case in which a printed index is of sufficient interest to merit transcription): &lt;back&gt; &lt;div type=\"index\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;Index &lt;/head&gt; &lt;list type=\"index\"&gt; &lt;li&gt;a2, a3, etc., 175-176&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Abbreviations, 3 &lt;list type=\"index\"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Percussion, 205-213&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Strings, 307&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/list&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Afterbeats, 77&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/list&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/back&gt; Note that if the page breaks in the original source have also been explicitly encoded, and given identifiers, the references to them in the above index can more usefully be recorded as links. For example, assuming that the encoding of page 77 of the original source starts like this: &lt;pb xml:id=\"text.P77\"&gt;&lt;/pb&gt; then the last item above might be encoded more usefully in the following form: &lt;li&gt;Afterbeats, &lt;ref target=\"#text.P77\"&gt;77&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/li&gt;",

Analogously, @x2/@y2 override @endho@endvo/@endto. If @to/@startto/@endto attributes are used, the start or end point is x-aligned with the indicated timestamp. If relative start coordinates (@ho/@vo or @startho/@startvo) are used, the origin of the coordinate system to be used for the start point is the first one found by the following search schema: If @startid is present, the origin of the referenced element; If the element is inside running text (e.g. inside tempo), the end of the preceding text or element; Otherwise, the origin of the containing element. The start point is offset from this origin by the value of the start coordinates (@ho/@vo or @startho/@startvo), using staff units. Analogously, the endpoint is determined using end coordinates (@endho/@endvo). If @endid is specified, it takes precedence over @startid. Examples of origins are: staff and layer: The horizontal origin is the starting point of the measure, the vertical one is the bottom staff line; note: The horizontal origin is the left end of the notehead, the vertical one the center of the notehead; clef: The horizontal origin is the left end of the clef, the vertical one the line specified by clef/@line (or @clef.line); For elements containing text: The left end of the baseline; symbolDef: As symbol definitions aren’t rendered directly, their coordinate system and origin are considered virtual. When they are referenced by symbol or @altsym, the origin of the context, i.e. the referencing symbol, is used. If neither absolute nor relative coordinates are specified, determining visually suitable start and end points for @line and @curve attributes is left to the rendering application. A value of 0 is not always assumed for absent relative coordinates. A typical example where a rendering application may not choose the origins of absent relative start and end coordinates to be the start point as well is the line connecting two notes in the above Schumann example.",

However, if @curvedir is present, the curve must respect the curvature direction specified there. The attributes @bezier and @bulge define the shape of a curve in two different ways. If both are present, a rendering application may choose either one. They override @curvedir. @bezier defines the inner control points of a cubic Bézier curve, i.e., a Bézier curve with two inner control points. The coordinates are given by a space separated list, first x and y offsets for the first control point, then x and y offsets for the second one. The x and y offsets are given in staff units (or inside the context of symbolDef in abstract units). The offsets for the first inner control point are relative to the start point, the ones for the second inner control point are relative to the end point. The @bulge attribute allows specification of the curve shape by a number of interpolation points. The interpolation points are given by their distance from the line connecting the start and end point. The distance values are stored as a space separated list. The interpolation points are calculated as follows: If @bulge provides n distance values, the connection line is divided into n+1 subsegments of equal length. The interpolation points are found by drawing a perpendicular line of the respective length at each subsegment joint. Positive distance values are drawn to the left of the connection line (left when traveling from start to end), negative ones to the right.
